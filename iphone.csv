For my husband - happy with it,12,iphone
Speaker mic does NOT work freezes and dies and siri mic does NOT work,13,iphone
Yes my daughter loves it but the charger went out in a week i replaced it but over no problems thanks,14,iphone
Flashlight did not work and Pandora radio intermittently went out.,15,iphone
The battery doesnt really hold a charge. But other than that its good,16,iphone
"Great condition, but low quality of the boxing. The wall charger would not work and glitches in and out. The home button is a little off.",17,iphone
My phone arrived promptly and transferring my old information to the new phone was seamless.,18,iphone
It doesn't work right now. Just used it for a week. Never buy from this seller. The home button doesn't work now. Battery is even worse.,19,iphone
I<U+2019>m happy it arrived on time. I<U+2019>m enjoy it.,20,iphone
"I've had this phone for less than 5 months, and its already dead!!! The phone has an old battery and there are many glitches!! Whenever I try using, it randomly switches off at 50% or higher. This was either a used phone or a fake one!! I don't recommend people to buy it. I would like Amazon to allow me to return this phone!",21,iphone
At first I was a little iffy about this but when I  got it I was so amazed great service <U+0001F929>,22,iphone
"it is good ,but I would like to know if it is working n libya or no",23,iphone
"After only seven months of buying this phone it completely goes out on me.  Totally dead.  I had to take it today to some far away Apple Store to have it properly diagnosed and fixed, praying it was just a battery issue.  It was a hardware issue.  This ""new iPhone""  of seven months, according to the Apple employee, is actually three years old, and had been previously purchased by someone else through a Verizon store.  And it had been opened and repaired too.  I can't believe Amazon sells such a scam to its customers.  I want to be fully reimbursed for this product.  Buyers, beware.",24,iphone
"Its a fake phoneApple iPhone 6 (GSM Unlocked), 16GB, Gold",25,iphone
"Cannot hear anyone talking on speaker phone, makes weird noise and freezes, battery life is terrible was very unhappy with this purchase.",26,iphone
I hated the fact that it was unlocked!,27,iphone
it was what expected!,28,iphone
"product arrived bad, I had to return it",29,iphone
Super I love it <U+0001F60D>,30,iphone
The worst purchase I've ever done. No even a year of purchase and the cellphone stopped working and the authorized seller said it was apparently refurbished and some parts inside were not the original ones.,31,iphone
"This is very bad product. The screen is taken a part and I can even see the inside material. It work okay, but it was use phone and they didn't fix correctly.",32,iphone
"Ordered This iphone last summer... started using it late November of 2017... Since the beginning it has been dropping calls, I did not have this problem with my old iphone. I took it to tech support at my service provider they replaced the sim and it still drops calls. Now today the homebutton stopped working all of a sudden. I'm nowhere close to having this repaired and it's crazy how it just stopped working at once... it's beyond inconvenient not having my fingerprint code & missing important work calls.... what are the warranty's on this product?!",33,iphone
It came all messed up,34,iphone
perfect for my daughter,35,iphone
Phone arrived as expected with no problems.,36,iphone
AMAZING!,37,iphone
is very good,38,iphone
"This phone is absolutely NOT new... I have bought this for my sister as a gift and, after one year of use she brought it to iPhone store and they verified that, the phone's screen was replaced twice. The whole phone was reassembled.",39,iphone
"I am very happy with this purchase.Initially I worried after reading some reviews...However so far I<U+2019>ve been very satisfied, the package came quickly, the phone is in great condition, works like brand new:) No issues so far<U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB>",40,iphone
Biggest Piece of crap phone I have ever purchased. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER / REMOBILE,41,iphone
Clean as mentioned,42,iphone
I would like to try this product before I buy it.,43,iphone
It<U+2019>s not original. I went to an apple store to fix it and they tell us that the cell phone has parts that are not original. That was really embarrassing,44,iphone
Phone is working like New phone. Thank Amazon you nice product.,45,iphone
en  4 meses  aparecio un problema que me han dicho que este Apple es de ano 2015 y que la tela fue cambiada. yo fue en la Apple aqui en Brasil.in 4 months a problem appeared that I have been told that this Apple is from year 2015 and that the fabric was changed. I was at the Apple here in Brazil.,46,iphone
Nice phone,47,iphone
"Phone was bought worked 2 weeks. Took it to Apple store , doesn't even have an iPhone screen on it! Obviously refurbished very poorly.  To have replaced will cost two hundred ninety nine dollars. Shoddy product!",48,iphone
top,49,iphone
"phone is OK, but delivery got lost twice before it finally arrived.",50,iphone
"ordered the phone, and it had a bad battery.",51,iphone
I was a little worried but I like this phone.,52,iphone
Product was nice. I liked it.,53,iphone
The phone suddenly stopped working. The apple store told me that it was modified and refurbishef with a defective battery. I am angry and disappointed.,54,iphone
"Screen failed and button stopped working. Took it to Apple store for replacement. They checked serial number, and phone had already been replaced. This is a used, broken phone sold as new.",55,iphone
Just got my phone today actually writing this with it at the moment lol but yes they are legit I was skeptic at first because iv seen people receive play doe on other pages but I ordered and I am very satisfied,56,iphone
I did not order this or any other phone from Amazon.,57,iphone
nice,58,iphone
"After 8 months with what I thought was a new I IPhone 6, started having trouble...  took it to an Apple service center and discovered that many parts are counterfeit.  Warped screen. Not original Apple.  Screws missing.  Loose works inside,  Dirt getting in.  So far no help from the seller.  Hard to believe that this is a mistake.  It's not even refurbished.  To say that I am unhappy is an understatement.",59,iphone
Too many glitches,60,iphone
Doesn't work at all!! Tried multiple times to get service & nothing worked. Worst Christmas present ever!,61,iphone
Ok,62,iphone
This phone rings when ringer off and the volume button is constantly showing on the screen. Not sure if it<U+2019>s a bug but never had a problem with my iPhone 5,63,iphone
"the body of the phone is awesome,  its in good condition but the internal headphones have something wrong with it (when i'm on the phone i can't hear other people talk unless i put it on speaker!!!!",64,iphone
"The battery was bad, It Stayed charged for 5 minutes then died, Spent 40$ and put a new one in myself took me like 10Minutes. The phone works now Perfectly. I'm not too mad. I did buy it used and cheap, Still saved 200$ XD.",65,iphone
I bought this for a friend in need and this phone lost its charge frequently. Do not buy.,66,iphone
While setting up the phone....... it died. Phone also was bent. Lasted all of 30 min while unplugged from the charger.,67,iphone
Very good!,68,iphone
Siri did not work.  Also could not hear during phone calls.  Took this NEW phone to Apple Store and they told me the Audio was defective.  They also told me the phone was activated November 2014.  Returned phone immediately.,69,iphone
perfect,70,iphone
Great product and good seller !!,71,iphone
Had problems from the start. Battery dies quickly.,72,iphone
I ordered iPhone 6 fully unlocked but when i put sim card it wasn't work. So why said that fully unlocked ? I will never recommend to buy this.,73,iphone
"Item was exactly how seller described. I am a seasoned iPhone user, therefore i am aware of their battery issues (not holding charge after a year or two of use). Being a refurbished phone, the battery was used before. So there was no surprise when this phone would not hold a charge for more than 6 hours and would die before it reach 50% battery life. I contacted the seller about the issue and they had no problem shipping me a battery swap kit. This was stressful as there were delicate connections that needed to be removed and reconnected later. Luckily i knew to youtube a video walk through of the process. The swap worked and I couldn't be happier. Well worth the money and the seller took care of me. definitely buying my next phone here.",74,iphone
Fake IPhone. Touch the apple logo on the back. You<U+2019>ll find sharpness. Apple logo is built in meaning you can<U+2019>t feel the logo when u touch,75,iphone
Fake phone! DO NOT BUY! Horrible! Bought this phone a year ago for my son and he broke it.  Took it in to get it repaired to find out it's a fake iPhone!!! Probably not going to be able to repair it and am out over $400 <U+0001F621>,76,iphone
amazing,77,iphone
Great phone!,78,iphone
"Perfect condition phone, gsm unlocked as stated. The only problem I've found at all is the battery does die when it gets too cold. Other than that, absolutely perfect. Great buy!",79,iphone
"got the phone from VIPOUTLET and came locked.contacted the seller with no resultwaste of money, feel very frustrated",80,iphone
Loved my phone in the beginning. Then 6 months later phone started to do weird things and on the 7 month it completely shut off.,81,iphone
I've been charging this phone for litterally 4 hours and it will NOT turn on . Only the battery sign will pop up,82,iphone
This is a bad product. I found that this product is old product looks like someone used and now facing battery issue. I would request everyone don<U+2019>t buy this product from this seller.,83,iphone
The touch screen didn't even work.,84,iphone
Hello I'm trying to use the device and says it's locked.,85,iphone
I am very unhappy with what occurred.  I purchased this item as a new factory item and just yesterday I was at apple to try to fix a battery issue with the Iphone and found out that it was a resold item (Apple had it as a phone purchased in 2015).  So I am stuck with a phone with defect and that does not have a manufacture warranty as I thought it would have. I'm discusted.  I am considering not to purchase any electronic device from Amazon!,86,iphone
"Don't buy this product. It isn't coming on, not charging and it was a trade in phone. This was the worst experience i ever had with an apple product.",87,iphone
****Save your money. iphones are junk. I bought an iPhone 6 and by the end of the first day it went back in the box and right back to Amazon. I will buy another Android phone and enjoy the flawless operation they provide at a much more reasonable price. In my opinion Apple should be shut down and ALL money refunded to the consumer. One star rating is too high.****,88,iphone
EVERYTHING FINE AND ON TIME,89,iphone
Phone last maybe 6 months with all kinds of problems don't buy from them,90,iphone
"so far, works great , as described",91,iphone
Bought this for my son for Xmas.  I had bought an unlocked phone years ago for my other son on Amazon.  I had a very unhappy son on Xmas day because it wouldn't accept the TMobile SIM card.  We even went to Tmobile on the 26th and they said it wasn't unlocked at all.  This product description is false or they didn't state which carrier the phone is unlocked for.  We are returning the phone and I strongly advice Amazon to screen its sellers because it's their name on the line!  My son worked so hard all semester to get good grades and prove he deserved an Iphone only to be disappointed on Xmas Day.  It broke my heart to see him not be able to enjoy his present.,92,iphone
"According to the seller, the item was suppose to be 9.9/10, like new! However, the front camera can be seen shifted to the side. An Iphone 7 case was given and does not fit on the Iphone 6. The box was also Iphone 7 box instead of the Iphone 6. No wall charger, no headphones. This is definitely not a like new phone that comes in an original box and is not 9.9/10. Mint condition should have no scratches. Complete waste of time.",93,iphone
"Battery came basically to have to change it. Cannot mute camera, so every time I take a picture a shooter sound goes off, pretty annoying. Other than that, works great!",94,iphone
Work well for a use phone.,95,iphone
"Christmas present for our daughter and battery is no good, seriously!! Now we have to spend more money for a battery and she's to wait to use.",96,iphone
"I received the phone but something wrong with it, it gets extremely hot while using and the battery drains in less than 5 hours even if i am not using it. I changed the setting, updated the software but still the same issue. I emailed the supplier but they didn<U+2019>t reply. Not recommending anyone to buy from this supplier.",97,iphone
Really worst product with scratches on screen and bent on back side.,98,iphone
"The only reason why I gave this two stars is because the item arrived on time.  This was the correct phone and looked nice, however, the screen is loose and the screen freezes and does not respond to touch after 1 minute of use and must be restarted to regain functionality.  I understand that the phone is refurbished, and expected a few scratches, but the phone not functioning and being defective is not acceptable.",99,iphone
Display backlight is gone after about 4 month of use. Contacted with seller and they said all support windows are closed after 2 month. Didn't check that since I was buying a new phone. Do not want to buy again.,100,iphone
The phone was NOT unlocked. It doesn't recognize my SIM card. Waste of money and a ripoff.,101,iphone
"Phone works, but SIM card holder is loose so it keeps going back and forth saying no service.",102,iphone
"Bought from AH TECH INC. Phone was sold as New and arrived in sealed box. Battery performance seemed to confirm that the product had not been used before. After a few months the charger died and the touchscreen appeared to have issues so the phone was sent to a repair shop. Upon taking the phone apart, the touchscreen turned out to not be a genuine Apple product. Buyer beware...",103,iphone
It's greats <U+0001F44C><U+0001F3FB>,104,iphone
Phone was not actually carrier unlocked.,105,iphone
"I had bought iPhone 6 16 GB on November 2016 and exactly a year after the screen cracked. The phone had gorilla screen protection but still cracked when it fell. When we took it to iCare, based on the EMEI#, the representative confirmed that this phone is not supposed to be sold as it had a defect. When we bought the phone, it was not mentioned it is a refurbished or old phone. Now since there is no record for sale for the phone, we are not getting proper maintenance support. Please do not buy from this seller.",106,iphone
Ok,107,iphone
The phone stop keeping the battery charged. I did change the battery and that wasn't the problem. The phone dies in 3 or 4 hours. I took it to apple and they say they couldn't help me because it is not an original phone. Amazon never responded to me neither the phone who sold me the phone.,108,iphone
"iPhone was blind very good condition. The recharging cord didn<U+2019>t work well, but no problem with the phone.",109,iphone
Phone is pre-paid locked to a USA carrier.,110,iphone
"Now is no good,I can<U+2019>t charge my iPhone !!!!",111,iphone
This phone was really a lemon. My son had it for a month and it totally quit working. I am now working with the seller to determine what to do. They are running an analysis on it to see what happened. They have been totally great to work with. I can<U+2019>t say enough about their excellent customer service. I<U+2019>m hoping just this particular phone was a problem because I have had iPhones for several years with no problems at all and have loved all of them.,112,iphone
"Hello , I was satisfied with my order but the phone screen has been giving me a hard time",113,iphone
The iPhone received was in good working condition with very little sign of usage and was looking new. I am writing this review after checking the phone performance continuously for last few days and I found no issues so far with the phone.  It's definitely Good value for money,114,iphone
"A great phone, but the charging cord only lasted two months.  Doesn't seem like we should have had to spend another $19 to replace the cord so soon.",115,iphone
Get this one...because it does everything iPhone 4 through 10 do and costs almost nothing now! So good deal...for a phone.  I owned this for over a year and bought it from a seller on Amazon.  Came in perfect new condition.  I sold it though.  It has a bright clean nice screen...slim size...and worked almost flawlessly. Here<U+2019>s the rub...I dislike iPhone and Apple now.  They do nothing anymore to be ahead in tech...the whole company bases their value on a phone that Steve Jobs made many many years ago now!!! I suggest skipping iPhones...and doing something different...pick something else... that is anything else...then this! Oh also...not that comfy in hand...good luck with that!,116,iphone
Was what I expected works fine,117,iphone
phone stop work.. i need explain from seller !,118,iphone
awesome perfect always will but from hear,119,iphone
The phone was even better then I expected I had no problem using it and it<U+2019>s working just fine,120,iphone
Will buy again.,121,iphone
"This is my first iPhone and I am not disappointed at all. I like the fingerprint scanner to unlock my phone and for saved passwords. Takes a little getting used to but I really like it. It seems quite durable, but that could be largely due to the phone case I got for it as I tend to drop my phones quite often.",122,iphone
"Is not a NEW Apple phone, i had the phone for 9 months and the batery started tu fail, so i took my phone to a cell phone repair center.When they opened the cover, it had a little sticker with chinnese letters and the batery had been changed once time before",123,iphone
My phone worked perfect! Thanks guys,124,iphone
"Never buy this phone. I ordered new unlocked phone, but to my surprise when i checked with apple store, they told me that this phone was purchased already 2 years ago and display screen is also fake not apple manufactured. Moreover this phone didn't work with any gsm sim cards. Not to buy this phone for international usage specially.",125,iphone
"I purchased this phone listed as new and a true Apple phone.  The phone hasn't worked correctly since I purchased it. So many things have gone wrong and  now it's hardly working.  I took it to the Apple store today and they informed me that it is a fake i-phone.  The apple logo was glued on the back,AND  therefore they can't repair it.  All  parts have been replaced with fake iphone parts.",126,iphone
Be careful buyers it is fake. It was the worst experience I have ever had. I bought it as a brand new phone but it suddenly stopped working over night without any reason. I had it only for a month or so when I took it to apple store they were not able to restore it and they told me the phone is not going to work any more.,127,iphone
battery didn't last 6 months,128,iphone
"Do not buy from this seller!! They sell defective pieces and they falsely claim manufacturer's warranty. I should have my warranty upto Dec 2017 but this seller bought the phone from Apple and sold it to me after the warranty EXPIRED and still advertised that I will have a warranty for one year from the time of purchase which is Dec 2016. I had some issue with my phone and when I took my phone to Apple(the manufacturer, as manufacturers warranty should apply) they told me that they cannot help me as I was sold the product after the expiration of warranty and that I was falsely advertised! I am contacting Amazon since 2.5 months regarding this issue  and they tell me that they would file a A-Z claim..and that an investigation would happen but that never happened. I keep calling them back and everytime I get  a response saying some claim did not go through properly and that they would re-do it for me. I called atleast 10 times spending about 2 hours each time. I also have several chats with agents and transcripts with me but noone ever got back to me! Very disappointed with the seller and Amazons customer service. My warranty will end on Dec 18th 2017 and I don't know if the idea is to push it so my warranty expires and then they can get rid of the issue.",129,iphone
"Phone was adverstized as ""new"" and on the box, but I knew somethibng was wrong when the iPhone started up without requesting any set up as usual.  Then it would not connect to the AT&T network. Had it verified by AT&T that my account was provisioned correctly and even with a new SIM card thinking it may be bad and it still would not connect and all phone settings were correct.  Very disappointed. RETURNED FOR REFUND. Would not buy again from this seller.",130,iphone
Phone is very hot. <U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621><U+0001F621>  You cannot hold the phone.,131,iphone
Amazing,132,iphone
"False advertisement by seller <U+201C>tested and certified<U+201D>. After a full recharge, the battery dies after 10 to 15 minutes of use.Never use this company.",133,iphone
Scam. Phone came packaged and everything but died after 3 months. I took to apple and the associate said the phone has been activated 2 years ago outside US. I came to believe it was a defective phone they refurbished and sold as new.,134,iphone
Good phone but poor packaging,135,iphone
Not whart I expected but it's ok,136,iphone
"Got what I wanted. Iphones were new, and unlocked.",137,iphone
Just received it and found in very good shape almost like new.Working like a charm so far...Happy shopping,138,iphone
"I bought this phone as new (at least I thought it is new). I sent it to my mom whom she lives in a different country. The phone stopped working after a few days. At first the screen popped out a few millimeters. And, after a while the screen stopped working.She took the phone to a place to fix it. When they opened it, they said inside there are a lot of missing components such as screws, and there are a lot of low grade components in it.",139,iphone
"Didn't work with ATT or T-mobile, don't buy it.",140,iphone
"DO NOT BUY!!! described as new and unlocked, and that was not the case, screen was replaced and was not an apple screen, I sent this phone overseas as a gift but no sim card worked on the cellphone. it was a bad decision to buy this phone, I lost the money as the return policy expired before the phone arrived.....",141,iphone
i did not had good experience from this seller as i came to know later this phone was not new and it was already used by someone in 2014 from service center. Was totally surprised when i came to know about this fact. phone's home button stopped working in 2 months suddenly and then it has to be totally replaced with brand new display in phone which cost me further 120 bucks.,142,iphone
Worst I have owned.  I've been with iPhone since the 3G and I wont be buying another.,143,iphone
"I have been using it for 7 months , haven<U+2019>t seen any issue",144,iphone
The phone looked over used and not as described by the seller,145,iphone
"I purchased the device in June, 2017. I was thinking to myself that I was purchasing a new phone since it was listed as new. Once I received the phone it worked perfectly fine until I made a phone call, whenever I was on the phone the other person could barely hear me and that was not because of my phones service....it was because of the phone itself. Later my phone began to move very slowly and lag when it was about to die. Recently November 29th my phone shut off and died and wouldn<U+2019>t come back on. I took it to the Apple store and they said my battery was gone and id come out better buying a new phone. The Apple store worker also got the phone<U+2019>s serial number and found that the phone was not new and was originally purchase May of 2016. With that being said the phone was not <U+201C>new<U+201D> as it was listed so basically it<U+2019>s being falsely advertised.",146,iphone
"Phone turns on but dies almost immediately,  The battery is garbage in doesn<U+2019>t hold a charge constantly freezes in switches from 0 to 100% .",147,iphone
Very good iphone .,148,iphone
"It is supposed to be a new item, however it is obvious that it is a refurbished iphone with the camera of bad quality and the screen is changed by spare parts not original. My problem is that I am from Ecuador and take a trip to buy but I was unable to return on time and get my money back.",149,iphone
Bought this <U+201C>unlocked<U+201D> phone and it was not unlocked it<U+2019>s locked to Att&T!,150,iphone
The phone antenna doesn't work. also the battery. It wasn't a new product and also the original guarantee was expired. Do not recommend to buy an iphone here,151,iphone
My screen is not the original one!,152,iphone
"The phone has completly frozen and there are no cracks or water damage, l want my money back.",153,iphone
Good work but I lost it after half of year,154,iphone
"The cell phone seemed great in the first days, after a week, the touchscreen stored working properly. It does not recognize id touch, and any simple task is hard to accomplish because if I touch somewhere, the screen recognizes in another spot.",155,iphone
It was in perfect condition and I got it as 'acceptable used' sometimes the call goes out if you talk ok speaker it goes out but I'm pretty happy about it,156,iphone
Using it for this review. No issues at all.,157,iphone
"Phone had internal, non-Apple parts as confirmed by Apple store. Phone would randomly shut off. DO NOT BUY!!!",158,iphone
"This phone is giving me problems, first of all the charger never worked out and the earphone are fake. Also the entry of the battery charger does not work, i am afraid this is a fake iphone.",159,iphone
"We just found out that its not original iphone and its duplicate look alike made by third party,very very disappointed to learn that Amazon is part of this rip off scheme and there no assurance that the things you buy on Amazon are not part of scam network.Thank to Jeff Bezos,world richest man after jumping off poor hard working peoples back.",160,iphone
"I bought this phone.  Omg I wish I never would have....  $475. 00 wasted,  the phone has been giving me problems ever since. My son wanted one but never again.. I called about it one before but no help was given to me at that time. I will never buy anything else electronic from Amazon again.  I was so disappointed,  now my son has no phone at all and now I have to find him another one,  but never again from amazon. There was a small dent in it,  it started having problems about 6 months after I bought it,  with the buttons not wanting to cooperate, searching for a signal.  I hate I bought this item. Very disappointed in Amazon.",161,iphone
IPhone was not new and after testing for one weak its faulty. Would not recommend buying from this supplier.,162,iphone
Very unhappy .  Wasted my money should've bought a new one  phone freezes .  Cannot move apps around a lot more don't buy it,163,iphone
I ordered a different color. They never have Space Gray.,164,iphone
"Zero stars!!!! Bought 4 months ago and it started to freeze, brought in to fix, and was told mother board is completely fried!????!?!!!?? My son saved his money for months and is so bummed out about this.",165,iphone
"The display of the iPhone 6 that I bought less than 3 months ago quit working. I took it to an Apple Store but was told could not be repaired. Also, the lightning cable did not work either. I tried to return it but did not see any option to do so because it has passed a certain period of time. This is very disappointing.",166,iphone
i liked it but the charger didnt work and it didnt come with orginal packaging,167,iphone
"I bought the product for gift in the post talks new cell phone, I took it to Brazil, at the time of the activation product used since 2014, freckles changed, mao I activate, cell phone does not work, I spent shame in the seller shop acted in a faith, I hope they solve, because I paid for a new product, came nima new box I'm very upset.",168,iphone
Very good,169,iphone
gives me a GUD SUCC,170,iphone
The product came without the headphones. The package wasnt the original one it looks like a refurbish phone.,171,iphone
The Phone is freezing and not working properly. I am not even sure if this phone is a new phone or refurbished....,172,iphone
I hate that my earphones were missing. I have no time to send back a phone. My loss. Guess i'll be buying earphones. What a mess. Rip off.,173,iphone
Great purchase.,174,iphone
The package arrived in good condition. Setup for the phone was simple and it is working perfectly.,175,iphone
I bought two of these phones about a year ago at the same time and although I<U+2019>ve had minimal issues with the phones themselves after taking one into a repair shop for minor work I was told the phones have refurbished parts in them.  This is NOT what I purchased. I purchased NEW phones and that is not the case. After reading through all the since then reviews I should just be lucky I didn<U+2019>t get playdough in my box!! Buyer beware!!! Take your money elsewhere.,176,iphone
Had the old battery even though the recall would have been free was supposed to be reconditionedSo the phone shuts down 2-3 times a week,177,iphone
Sold as new but in less than a year(9 months) the phone is not working and in Apple services they told us that is a reburbished phone with the back serial erased and for system was repaired three times.Totally dissapointed from vendor,178,iphone
"the cell phone only lasted 3 days, it came hit, it is used and it says it is new, it is incredible I feel cheated by the seller Quick Dealzz, be very careful when buying it are false",179,iphone
Very disappointed. Has a vibrating noise everytime I make calls. Its annoying.,180,iphone
"The worst experience, the cell didn<U+2019>t get  some parts and the screen was damaged",181,iphone
I<U+2019>m so glad about the product. Brand new and as advertised.,182,iphone
"The phone was sold as ""New"" to me last year in November. The screen and the LCD died in 11 months. I took it to a device repair shop and they opened it in front of me. Found there were missing screws, non-original screen and battery, signs of old water damage and fingerprints inside.. New??? Sure !! Don't  waster your money on a product that is sold with a LIE.",183,iphone
I bought this phone for my daughter but after two month she start  having issues such the phone was not charging and when she took it to a technician he said the mother board was faulty as a result the phone is of no use .,184,iphone
Awesome phones.,185,iphone
"- Very good iPhone 6, NEW and good price.Thank you",186,iphone
I purchased this phone for my son and was absolutely thrilled and pleased to  receive it in it's excellent condition and functionality . My son is very happy with it as well.Thank you very much for a wonderful product and I will recommed whenever necessary.,187,iphone
I love it!,188,iphone
"Unfortunately, after months of difficulty with this phone, I've learned that it wasn't new (as advertised)when I purchased it and that it isn't an Apple product but a fraud.  The Apple store has confirmed this.",189,iphone
"I loved it at first until it immediately started to freeze and would not let me unlock it. Even if I managed to get it unlocked after rebooting and waiting now DAILY it won't even click on an app that I am trying to use. It just opens random apps and will open up my messages and random letters or emojis will start typing. It wasn't a big deal at first because it was occasional but now I can't even get into my phone for the last couple days. I am extremely disappointed and will be contacting seller for a refund. Might as well use the money to fix my iphone 5 screen because other than the screen, I've had no issues with that phone and have had it for years whereas I have only had this one for not even a whole month. Lesson learned, NEVER BUY A REFURBISHED IPHONE!",190,iphone
"BEWARE - DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLERThe internal speaker stopped working, therefore I took it to an apple store. Apple verified most of the parts installed were third party! Screen, internal speaker and some other internals. Certainly not a brand new phone! Apple couldn't even fix the issue due to all the third party components. There were screws and other items floating around the phone! A WASTE OF MONEY and FALSE ADVERTISING!",191,iphone
Great item and seller!,192,iphone
"Very prompt shipping and delivery. The phone was in good condition except for a very small dent near the audio jack. The screen is certainly not an OEM, you can see the backlight from the edge of the screen near the volume hard keys. Everything works as advertised no problems setting up with a T-mobile sim card. The seller also included a tempered glass screen protector.",193,iphone
"Hey , I would love to promote this product  , if I get it for free I would leave my amazing  feedback everywhere in social media",194,iphone
Bought this in a new condition. The product  didnt last for more than 6-7 months. Rear camera died saying flash needs to cool down before camera can function. black spots starts appearing on the screen. 350$ in trash. defintely not a user fault or water damage. please visit a apple store if you want to buy a new one.,195,iphone
Phone was not unlocked,196,iphone
"Very nice. I was a bit scared when I saw the AT&T chip inside the box, coming under the assumption that it was a locked phone. However, it was not locked I was able to use my GSM carrier.",197,iphone
Protects my IPad just as I hoped without the bulky feel.,198,iphone
The phone is not working. The phone is not unlocked.,199,iphone
Received the phone and it looks nice!,200,iphone
Great quality,201,iphone
"The phones do not charge properly.  They worked OK for the few month or so then glitches started, the return window closed, and now they will not hold a charge.",202,iphone
"Today, after many weeks with overheating and battery problems, a cracked screen made me go the Apple Store. There, I found out that the screen was not an Apple screen.During the iPhone's analysis, the Genius concluded that - and I quote - ""this phone is has been tampered so much, that it's far from an iPhone"". It had many false parts, and there were a lot of stickers in Chinese inside the phone!! There were pieces missing, and the piece that makes the phone vibrate had 2 screws loose. He stated that there were so many pieces (including the screen) that were NOT Apple, that there was absolutely nothing that could be done through the Apple Store!Now, this phone - as it states on the receipt received after the purchase - was ""Apple iPhone 6 16 GB Factory Unlocked -BRAND NEW - SEALED !!!"". Therefore, I demand to have my money sent back to me, because this is FAR from what was agreed!",203,iphone
Well I'm very impressed with this product. It works fine. Only minor dents and damage. Overall good refurbished phone. But one major problem. The charging port and Jack port are broken. The jack port doesn't hold in the headphones so they slide out like butter. And sometimes it doesn't even work. And the charging port is broke too. Sometimes it doesn't even charge and I need to unplug and replug a ton for it to work. I would like a new one. I would be willing to send this one back as well.,204,iphone
"This started to fall apart in 5 months, I took it to apple store and it turned out to be counterfeit! Apple store determined that this was not an Apple product but a counterfeit device. BEWARE!",205,iphone
The phone came in the original box with the power cord and the headphones. It<U+2019>s looks like new. Then I check the IMEI number and it was out of warranty. After three months using it one day I plugged to charge and the phone started in a loop showing the apple logo and then turned off. Went to an apple store and they said I need a replacement that is gonna cost 299.00. Really!!!! Never bother to buy a phone from this people...,206,iphone
"My granddaughter got this phone for her birthday gift , and she loves it !!!",207,iphone
good worth the price!,208,iphone
"IPhone 6 .... cheaper than the newer ones. SHipped fast and safe, we're happy with the performance.",209,iphone
Never worked. Kept saying no sim. Tried multiple sims,210,iphone
Like it a lot.,211,iphone
The phone looked brand new but could not keep a charge would drain after 30 minutes of use.  I<U+2019>ve become less trusting of buying refurbished items from amazon.. to much of a hassle Buyers beware!,212,iphone
Thanks a lot,213,iphone
"This phone is new as described and met every product description; however, it is a restricted phone, meaning the phone doesn't work on AT&T existing networks.The original retailer who sold it to ELECTRONIC DEALS didn't un-restrict the phone, so when I tried to activate it with a new sim card It didn't work. AT&T told me I had to contact the original retailer, the business who sold the phones, to ELECTRONIC DEALS to call AT&T to un-restrict the phone. ELECTRONIC DEALS wasn't able to fix the situation, they didn't know the original retailer and offered a certified refurbished phone.This is the second vendor I went to on amazon and had a phone that didn't meet my expectation. I spoke with the vendor and they said that they had issues with the phone and new sim-card activations. They may have not known, but they didn't do anything to fix the situation, beside replacing it with a phone that I couldn't trust.",214,iphone
Phone worked fine,215,iphone
Di it work.<U+0001F614>,216,iphone
Excellent,217,iphone
It was really slow and it didn't work so well i had to buy another one,218,iphone
"BEWARE*** Phone is a $400 piece of garbage!! Microphone doesn't work, so the only way to talk is to have it on speaker phone! Had the phone for 10 months and can't return it! JUNK!!!!",219,iphone
great device. I am still using it and it works great. the glass on the display is in great condition. very reliable phone!,220,iphone
since we got the phone its hard to charge and acts up,221,iphone
"Bought new and after a couple of months the display was defective. Took to apple only to find out there were no warranty on the product, and now have to pay $129 to fix it.",222,iphone
Great deal and the phone works great!,223,iphone
"iPhone works great, but the charger isn't so good.",224,iphone
great product,225,iphone
"So, I was all happy go lucky when I purchased my new iPhone 6 until I received it and used it for about three months. The phone turned off and never came back on. I was told that the battery went bad and it happens a lot with iPhones. I find that hard to believe when I have friends who have had theirs for years. Either way, be careful with iPhone 6!  Buying one to replace it isn't cheap!",226,iphone
The home button stopped working which has never happened on the last 8 iPhones I have had. Took it for repair and found out that the iPhone is entirely refurbished and does not have any Apple genuine parts at all. This is a rip off. When I bought the phone the description was it was an Apple iPhone factory unlocked and even the serial number of phone has been imitated. I need my money back!!,227,iphone
"The battery is not good enough, the low battery comes to fast I can<U+2019>t even use it during the day without plugging in it.",228,iphone
"The phone looks great on the outside and it came in the mail quickly. Though, I don't know why but the battery only lasts for two to three hours which is unfortunate because I don't have the resources to be charging it throughout the day. To last most of the day I have to have the brightness down all the way and put it on airplane mode! This is so inconvenient because my job requires me to check my emails throughout the day. This means I have to buy a new phone, I am very disappointed in this product.",229,iphone
"Not unlocked as described, locked for AT&T sim only.  No charger and headphones in the box either. Very sad that amazon entertains sellers of this kind.",230,iphone
it work 3 months thn it get broken,231,iphone
arrived in good condition,232,iphone
"I couldn't charge it after one month using it, even though I tried more than 20 wires. I took this phone to Apple store, and was told it seemed that the phone was opened and potentially something was switched, affecting the internal circuit, which would be the only logic reason for its inability to charge.Since the Apple store is not supposed to open up the phone and help me fix it, most annoying thing was that according to the system of Apple, this phone was originally purchased way early than I purchased it from this seller. So the Apple store is not able to switch a new phone for me. So I am stuck, and ended spending more than $400 for a phone that I can't even turn on.I would NEVER buy anything from this seller or any non-Apple official store if I ever want an iPhone again or any  related product. I suggest you do the same.",233,iphone
Was not correctly unlocked and currently cannot connect to any phone provider but other than that shipment arrived early and functions of the phone is 100%. But sadly can't use it <U+0001F614>,234,iphone
good service good shipping service but the had more scratches than described and battery was almost out of life cycle,235,iphone
<U+0131> cant use this item in turkey and also <U+0131>ts not new <U+0131>ts used. you have to reach me <U+0131> am gonna give you to the court.,236,iphone
I am very pleased with my iPhone 6,237,iphone
"when I took it to service, I was shocked to hear from applecare that this phone had been activated 1.5 years before my date of purchase.I purchased it as a brand new one but it was not new. so be aware.",238,iphone
"The battery doesn't work, beisdes that, the charger is broke and it's NOT unlocked as it said",239,iphone
"Somethings wrong here.  This is supposed to be the same as any other iPhone 6.  However, the screen goes black with polarized glasses in the normal vertical position so I can<U+2019>t view the maps in my car unless I turn it sideways.  This does not happen with my work iPhone 6.  My work iPhone can rotate 360 degrees and still be viewed with polarized glasses In any position.  Not so with this phone.  The battery also lasts about 1/3 shorter and the cell reception side by side with my work iPhone is a bar to 2 bars less.  I struggle getting cell reception in a lot of places.  I<U+2019>ve confirmed it is an Apple phone and not a knockoff.",240,iphone
"Bought this phone in March of this year. THOUGHT it was new. As of yesterday, the phone is DEAD! Gone. So is the money we spent on it. Had to replace with a brand new phone. Found out it was sold originally in 2014 and was out of warranty. Will never buy a phone from here again.",241,iphone
Defective front camera,242,iphone
"Originally bought the phone from this seller in November 2016 however, it did not work properly (would not stay charged and died within a few minutes of being off the charger). Thought it was just a random bad phone as those things happen sometimes. Returned the phone and received a full refund. Bought another phone from the same seller in December 2016 because it was the only one that stated the phone was new in the description. The new phone randomly quit working in August 2017. Screen just went black one day. When it was taken apart to see if it could be fixed it was missing a bunch of screws. Other screws were rattling around in the phone! It was obviously a very bad refurbish job and the phone was most definitely NOT new. Phone was unable to be fixed.",243,iphone
if it have all,244,iphone
The telephone set. Constantly low battery. In a call the charge was lowered,245,iphone
Delighted with the product.... Although I was very hesitant to buy earlier but the decision was good,246,iphone
"My phones software crashed. It now has no warranty. As per repair shop, it would take me another  $200 to repair it excluding the Labour charge",247,iphone
My iPhone is getting very hot  I have no idea why this is happening,248,iphone
"I went to Apple store today, I type in series number the phone is a faked one.",249,iphone
"So i Got this Iphone on May 20th of this year and i started using it right away now at first the phone was fine not showing any signs of problems. Now had i left my review at that point this would have been a 5 star Rating however using the phone for 4 Months all of a sudden my ""unlocked Phone"" refuses to accept any Carrier. Just says ""No Service"".Now im not one to leave neagtive reviews usually but spending that kind of money, im expecting to have use of the phone for at the very least one year before i anticipate problems of any nature. I had tried through amazon to reach the seller but have had no communication from them so dissapointed, I regret to inform all that i wasted $300.",250,iphone
The product is very goood but sometimes the touch does not work 100% as they said.,251,iphone
the NEW iPhone 6 does not turn on at all.,252,iphone
Bad Experience,253,iphone
The iPhone last a month then it went black... haven't get a response from the seller,254,iphone
like it,255,iphone
"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PROVIDER. I had this phone for one week, had it serviced, and couldn't stand it anymore. It had a motherboard issue where the flex cable attached, so the wifi, GPS, and bluetooth all would not work. After a few days it would also drop off of my cell provider as well.",256,iphone
"We're very happy with this purchase.  It came quickly, works perfectly, and looked almost like new.",257,iphone
I bought an Apple IPhone 6s new from factory on April 2017. The phone worked fine for almost 3 month (it was in the box for 2 months) after that a problem with the signal / reception came. It was not  able to find the network. I asked the seller for changing it or for repair it. I never had a positive response. They say it was out of warranty. I check on the web Apple has up to 2 years warranty on some areas.,258,iphone
After having this phone for several months the touch became funky on it. I have taken it to several shops in which they inspected it and couldn't figure out what exactly was wrong with it. I had them replace the screen and it would still work only every now and then. Most of the time it wouldn't work at all. They finally figured out that the chip in the phone responsible for the  touch was malfunctioning. They told me that this could not be fixed as it had to be microscopically repaired or replaced. I am guessing that buying a certified refurbished cell phone leaves nothing certified adequately.,259,iphone
My battery started having issues a few months into using it. The phone turns off a couple of times a day even when the battery is fully charged. I took it into an apple store and was told that the battery is not the original and the phone might not be a new one. I was duped by the seller.,260,iphone
"It doesn't work.I bought this phone 3 months ago, and it started to fail. This phone does not capture the signal from the telephone line, soit's no good at all, I can't make calls, or send texts. It is a fraud and I can't ask for a refund or another cellphone. It is not fair that you pay for a product that it is not what they ofer. You should attend this complaints, it is not fair!",261,iphone

I really appreciated it.Love it.",291,iphone
Good,292,iphone
Muy bien,293,iphone
"although the product generally works quite well, I can not give a higher score because when I buy it did not say it was rebuilt, and it is recast, since when I receive a call I have to put it on the speaker so that I can listen and that way the other person I hear with difficulty what I say.",294,iphone
good product.,295,iphone
"Off brand, tampered with. Had to return, do not buy.",296,iphone
This phone was said to be new.  We had trouble with the battery and took it to the Apple Store.  They noticed that the glass was not flush and suspected it had been tampered with.  Also noticed that the camera(rear) did not have the glass protecter.  We replaced the glass cover and the battery.  They told us that there were loose screws inside the phone.  Now the camera is fuzzy....  don't buy from this seller!!,297,iphone

There are missing screws, unauthorized seals and marks. Apple will not be able to replace it my device, since it was highly modified internally.",302,iphone
"It came in time and the cellphone was evidently new, but the little glass that covers the camera fell off after a few days of very little use, i dont understand how that happened because this smartphones are built to harsh use.",303,iphone

"Honestly I've been wanting an iPhone for a long time because I've been using android all my life. So I did some research and decide to buy the 6/6s. I thought gold was a good color and the price was pretty good too. It came in 4 days and totaled up to $229. I bought it from DEALFISHER!!! Y'all need to buy it from them!!! My phone came practically Brand New! It was in amazing condition! No scratches and it comes with a charger too. I'm so happy and satisfied with my purchase so I had to come out and represent them for giving me such a beautiful gift. I can Ft people play games, I stay losing but that's not the point lol.

"<U+00A0>This phone is a total waste of money and time after seven months from date of purchase the screen keeps blacking out and at time lines appear on the screen like the old black and white tv when tube was going out and the seller only gives 30days ,apple does not cover any thing so i am hanging dry 400 bucks gone apple is asking for 340 dollars so its not worth it am a very disappointed customer.",357,iphone
"My iPhone 6s was a Christmas gift from my parents. It serves its purpose; calls, texts, and social media apps, I am able to access this all from my phone. I am not a fan of Apple, personally finding that there are too many problems with its software. Every time there is an update, my phone slows down, and its battery life always seems to deteriorate. Should Apple fix these problems without having to purchase a new phone, then I will be one of their pleased customers. Until then, I will not be pleased or upset, but satisfied with what I was gifted.this is for a school assignment. please ignore.",358,iphone
"it does not say anywhere that this phone is refurbished, but when I went to the ATT store they said there was an aftermarket charging port and battery inside, which is why i was getting the message ""device not supported"" when using an Apple issued charger.",359,iphone
Iphone battery is not at all good.Battery is shutting down very quickly.Touch id is not working.,360,iphone
This iphone is not unlocked.,361,iphone
Really good...an awesome seller....,362,iphone
"I ordered this phone for just a month, but it not turn on anymore .",363,iphone
It worked perfectly & came as I expected when I purchased it .,364,iphone
It's battery was messed up & kept dying very quickly .,365,iphone
"Very neat condition, however the phone speaker is not loud, I had to put my calls on speaker if I want to hear my callers. I had to resort to using a Bluetooth headset with it.",366,iphone
I am very happy with this purchase the phone is working very well. and shipping very fast .,367,iphone
"Phone was a refurbished phone, but not advertised as such, that died within 4 months of use. It was taken to an Apple Store to verify that parts within the phone were, in fact third party parts that caused the phone to die.",368,iphone
"Hi, I have a problem with my phone that can not charge and I do not know what to do, and I have no other way",369,iphone
"It is litterally used one, and you can accept little scratches and screen problems(like water smear line? something like that). While you using it, you would not be conscious. Thus, entirely, satisfied.",370,iphone
This phone's battery does not work below 40%. Terrible product,371,iphone
Product couldn't be sold (according to Apple support). It didn't work.,372,iphone
"Could not get 4G LTE to work, Checked with AT&T several times to talk to multiple agents and with Apple but no JOY.Plus battery was very flaky. Sometimes it would hold a charge for almost a day and sometimes it wouldn't last 6 hours. Sometimes  it would say (for example) 70% battery and a few minutes later it would say 35%, then plug it in and immediately it would again show 70%.The seller of this certified reconditioned phone is trying hard to market iPhones at a reasonable price.  Dealfisher is ready to refund and gave me an extra credit for my trouble.I did purchase another iPhone from Dealfisher which I finally got to work. It also had a 4G LTE problem. Looked at the internet and found an answer that worked. Buy a another SIM card and turn cellular data on and off three times. Bingo!",373,iphone
Buen producto,374,iphone

"It had battery problems, the seller never answered my emails. Not recommended at all.",380,iphone
"Had to get an iPhone for my 91 year old mother because she has never had an Android. This one worked out great. If I were to do it again, I would get the refurbished one because it was so much cheaper than the new-off-the-shelf one. I didn't want to gamble on a refurb because my mother lives some distance from me and any problems would have been difficult to handle.",381,iphone
"the phone came with scratches, the battery can't hold 30 minutes, after 1000 pics the phone is freezing.",382,iphone
The iPhone is defective. It  shut down every 2 minutes. The battery run-down every second. The worse purchase I ever made online!,383,iphone
I bought this phone and I have sent email because this phone is not work. No one has reach out to me. I have been buy products from this company at this item really hurt me for spending this amount of money for a phone which is a dammy.,384,iphone
"I bought this iPhone as ""NEW"". Under the outer clear cover layer the white box was slightly SCRATCHED (?). On the bottom of the box was additional line of text added under the Apple product data. I took the iPhone to the Apple Store for a set-up and when technician opened the phone,he said that this phone was refurbished and some parts are not the original Apple' parts. I returned the phone back to Amazon.",385,iphone

The phone stopped working.Box not original from the phone.,390,iphone
This is not a new phone. It is refurbished. I cracked my screen after 3 months and went I went to the store to fix it they told me that the screen was already changed and it was not an original apple screen. I paid full price for a refurbished phone so I am upset. But the phone works fine.,391,iphone

"Phone was cracked and wouldn't charge after one day, no response to messages or calls. I know its a good company but I think they dropped the ball on me.",396,iphone
Good phone.. minor scratches on corners and charging points.,397,iphone

Phone was as described,400,iphone
Got as described. I have been using since couple of years. No any problems.,401,iphone
"great phone for a really good price at Deal Fisher.Of course there is always some risk when buying refurbished (not new) items, and there are many negative reviews out there.However this iPhone looked only slightly used, i.e. it was accurately described, and battery life is also good (not new but also not too far from it).This is not a review for the iPhone 6 itself, as there are heaps of other reviews for it already, but all I can say is that it is still one of the best smart phones on the market overall (I did use an Android phone before, but then switched to Apple, as it ""just works"" better overall... (but some drawbacks still exists, namely not to be able to directly transfer e.g. MP3 files to it... I use the work around via Amazon music which also lets you download your own music on to the device, via cloud service.... it is a bit more complicated but ultimately it works).",402,iphone
I have to replace the battery in a few days after using it,403,iphone
the battery is bad and the screen was changed so it is not totally new,404,iphone
lasted less than 6 months.,405,iphone
When I ordered it I thought it was gone be terrible but it actually came wonderful very fast An great packing huge thumbs up,406,iphone
"I was deceived, i paied for a new iphone, but what i received was an old iphone.",407,iphone
The battery drain fast,408,iphone
"phone was great for the first few months, then the screen started separating from the phone and screws were loose on the inside of the phone and a couple actually fell out it appears. order brand new and it seems i got a horribly refurbished phone. gps and bluetooth also don't work.  cannot trust this company, extremely disappointed and would never buy from again or recommend to anyone.",409,iphone
Hi! This phone keep sticking all the time. ..the screen is unresponsive. Even i have the apple latest update.very disappointed i must say . first time i can say Amazon must to do better. Thinking about replacement or refund.,410,iphone
Nice phone! Didn't get any ear buds with it!,411,iphone
"On December 2016 I bought an Iphone 6, I did not realize (because it was written in small letters somewhere down in the product description) that the telephone was refurbished. Ok that was my bad, but last week I realize that the phone screen was lifting from the case (I have never let the phone dropped) I took it to the apple store and they told me the telephone was refurbished and there were some pieces missing like some screws, and the screen was lifting from the case because it was CHINESE  and not an original piece from apple.I am already upset because the telephone was not what I expected but in apple store told me that every telephone refurbished MUST be with original pieces and working perfectly. Also there is a problem with the charging pin so sometimes don<U+2019>t  get the charge  and it damages  the ORIGINAL  CABLES.WHO IS GOING TO RESPOND FOR THIS FRAUD????",412,iphone
Phone works good,413,iphone
I personally had a every every extremely bad experience They don't even deserve a rating for false advertising,414,iphone
"good phone, was 64gb unscratched when arrived and seemed in perfect condition. only complaint was after a few months the battery span continues to grow weaker at a rapid rate.havent had it for a year yet but battery life only last 4 hours. 8 if left untouched.",415,iphone
Phone was in excellent condition. Works Great!!!!,416,iphone

When arrived this product was excellent but two months after the screen does not work good,418,iphone
"Could not be more pleased. Five stars to ""deal fisher"". Product arrived on time and as described. Ordered 2 pieces. One of them looked like new, the other one had minor scratches in the back. More important the screens on both were perfectly clean and scratchless. Highly reccomend this sellerBoth units worked perfectly out of the box. All features and functions responsive as expected from an iphoneThanks deal fisher!!!!!",419,iphone
SOME SCRATCHES.... USED,420,iphone
"This phone that they sent was 100% refurbished, but do not tell you that. The Phone battery lasts 1-2 hours with minimum use. and 6 months after, my home button just decided to stop. I am a regular shopper on amazon, and this one has to be the worst purchase by far.",421,iphone
amazing !,422,iphone
This was a used phone. Did not say that on the information about the phone. Very upsetting.,423,iphone
"Be careful when buying from this dealer since there is no warranty not even Apple's typical one year warranty. If you are out of luck and the phone stopped working, Apple won't touch it, as happened to me. The dealer, which has not disclosed lack of warranty, would not respond either.",424,iphone
The iPhone 6 doesn't work. Didn't turn on i have to return the iPhone. I was very disappointed with the product never buy from this company again.,425,iphone
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! I received the phone and it didn't even turn on. I've tried charging it for hours and it still hasn't worked . This is ridiculous... why would someone sell something that doesn't work? This was a waste of money and time.,426,iphone
I received the phone on time.  Isnt a bad buy.  However the usb used for charging peeled in no time had to get it replaced.  i find that the phone has power issues sometimes i would be at 20 percent and it would blank out really wasnt as impressive as the 4s,427,iphone
the main button broke within 2 weeks,428,iphone
Is good as I expect only battery  run out quickly,429,iphone
The phone does not work. It does not power up for more than 10 seconds. Its faulty!,430,iphone
Very Nice,431,iphone
Don't buy this product. My phone stopped working after 8-9 months and when I went to ape care they are saying it is seller locked. Please don't fall in trap looking at phone caption.,432,iphone
"I bought my phone 10 months ago, the first month the battery started working really bad, when I took it to the apple store they told me it had no guarantee, that it had expired (it was supposed to be new).  Than the camera lens protection just disappear, so now no camera, I took it to the apple store and they told me they do not repair it. So now I have a useless phone. I will never again by technology through Amazon, its the worst service I have ever experienced.",433,iphone
Very good experience,434,iphone
It is a wonderful item thank you,435,iphone
good product,436,iphone
I had a really good experience.,437,iphone
I bought this as a new phone.  Apple says it has multiple parts that were not Apple and refurbished. I got ripped off!!!,438,iphone
It came with a weird charger.,439,iphone
Nice phone,440,iphone
"This phone was awful.Within the first month the GPS stopped working. You couldn't use Waze without resetting the Location settings 5x or more, every single time you used it.Also, the ""myth"" about iphone6 bending is no myth. Also within the first month of having my i6 in the otterbox defender case, it got a nice curve to it.I will never , ever, everrrrrrr buy an apple product again after this. Nothing but modern trash.",441,iphone

"Excellent arrived as new, everything perfect",443,iphone
Excelent product !,444,iphone
"Like it, but the battery seems a little tired.",445,iphone

i love it so much,447,iphone
"I'm very happy I got this, my phone broke and I quickly replaced it. The only thing i suggest doing if you buy one also get a new battery.",448,iphone
"Bought a New iPhone 6, 16 GB, Unlocked From Fiestacellphonestx. The phone seems to be new, but it's clearly repacked and the box, envelope with documents inside and plastic wraps on elements in not genuine (THATS FOR SURE).BUT, the PHONE does seem to be NEW and WORKS FINE as well as LOOKS GOOD. I hope it's not fake or refurbished, because I am going to keep it regardless to the downfalls described above. Overall POSITIVE feedback to the seller and the item.",449,iphone
its a scam . phone worked for 2 months and one fine day decided to stop working. took it to apple store and they returned saying its a fake apple iphone.,450,iphone

"Phone was in good shape physically. No scratches, arrived on time with everything included. However the battery is bad and phone dies in less that 30 mins after charge. Will have to purchase a new battery. I feel I'm being generous here with a 3-star rating.",457,iphone
"The screen stopped working in just about two months, and the antenna was damaged which now makes the signal reception very bad. Tried to return it but the customer service is bad.  I would not recommend buying this product from this seller.",458,iphone
Phone  can not call,459,iphone
"My Iphone 6 died after 3 months of use. I didn't drop it, but the display suddenly stopped responding and vertical lines appeared. The device was sold as new, but apple warranty expired many years ago.",460,iphone
"It is a very convenient phone that offers all utilities  you could possibly need , Perfect size and weight , fits well in your pocket , The only drawback is battery life which lasts approximately for around 26 hours .",461,iphone
its ok,462,iphone
I love this phone it defiantly met my expectations but. There was a problem with the ringer in which there will always be sounds on my phone. But who the hell cares I still love it.,463,iphone
"The phone looked fine and as if it was a good quality, but it had a horrible glitch where I couldn't actually use it without things jumping all over the place. I had to return it.",464,iphone
Didn't work. Had fake system components,465,iphone
iPhone was still locked under AT&T contract. Not a new iPhone and not unlocked.,466,iphone

defective item,472,iphone
Delivered on time and phone works perfect.,473,iphone
Great Product,474,iphone
Great cell phone,475,iphone
"This is not a ""new"" iPhone6, and possibly not a genuine iPhone all together.  It had no scratches and the packaging seemed legit. But right away I noticed that the screen protruded out with rough edges, which means the phone was either refurbished or not a genuine iPhone. The Apple store clerk I showed it to concurred, as did a couple of iPhone6 users whose phones I compared my device to.",476,iphone
Fake phone,477,iphone
I purchase the phone for 15 year old to my surprise he was very excited and I was satisfied with my purchase the phone look better than my iPhone I will purchase another iPhone from Amazon without any hesitation. Thank you<U+0001F917>,478,iphone
Perfect,479,iphone
Battery became useless in few month.. I keep getting messages from Verizon that phone is a fraud.,480,iphone
Great phone. No problems. Fast delivery.,481,iphone
I love it. Meets all my needs.,482,iphone
"I was very skeptical about ordering a used phone, but the shipping was fast and the product was in great condition as promised.It was an unlocked phone that I ended up using for straight talk (via their sim card option) and I have not had any issues with it since.Very happy with this purchase and and overall quality of the phone.It came in a protective casing with a display protector and charger. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of buying a phone directly from the providers and rather wants to choose by having an unlocked phone.",483,iphone
works great. love it.,484,iphone
The phone was great for about 2 months before it stopped charging. The tip of the cable wiggles around inside the lightning port on the phone so it has to be finagled in order to get it charging. I've never dropped the phone and I've had it in a Spigen case since I got it. Of course the 2 month time frame was well beyond the return window so I've just been S.O.L this whole time with a phone that barely works.,485,iphone
"Do not Buy this item, It comes looking like a brand new product, the box to the device appearance, the charger, and the headphones. But none are apple genuine products. The phone itself was not a new phone. Please do no buy this product,",486,iphone
worked great FOR ABOUT A MONTH... THEN touch screen stopped responding - slowly at first then gradually worsened over time.  (Phone was kept in lifeproof case the entire time I had it)  Looked into getting the phone fixed by apple since warranty was up after 90 days.  Apple asked if the screen had ever been replaced to know which route to take in fixing the problem.  Contacted company and asked so I could take the correct steps in fixing the problem and all they would tell me was my warranty was up on this product - and wouldn't give any further information.,487,iphone
Phone I received was in excellent condition as promised and was worth the money I paid for it.,488,iphone
"I took my phone to the Apple store today because the screen was pulling away from the back.  Apple informed me that not only had my ""new"" phone been logged into before I purchased it, it was also not an authentic Apple product.  It is missing the serial number on the back of the phone and is from a third party. I want my $ back!!",489,iphone
"This phone was advertised as new and factory unlocked.  It was neither.  When I began to have screen issues two months after receiving it, we took it to an Apple store where they checked the serial number.  It had been purchased previously through Verizon and it was no longer under warranty.  This is a total ripoff.",490,iphone
"When I had first got the phone (from Third-Party) it wouldn't even turn on for like a whole 2 hours. Finally, I get it to turn on and the screen starts to act funny over the course of 3 weeks. Mind you I not once did I dropped the phone. So I tried to return the phone and had to wait decades from a response from the seller by the time the warranty is over. Now I'm stuck with this malfunctioning iPhone with no way of getting my money back!",491,iphone
"great product ,perhaps with higher than 16 GB.",492,iphone
excellent product,493,iphone
Loved everything about my new phone. Disappointed I can not get my Find My Friends app on my new phone. Just had an software update and hoped that would alleviate my problem - but it didn't. I still haven't found a solution.,494,iphone
"I only had this phone 7 months and it has quit . Had it in a case and all , it just quit on me.",495,iphone
"learned my lesson. sure enough I am stuck with a phone that Locks up and screen won't respond . Haven't had long at all bought it June 16th, its August 2nd. , and  yes won't buy used again. My first bad purchase on Amazon. Still have my iphone 5s so guess when this thing just flat out won't work least I didn't get rid of it. But now out 290 bucks,,",496,iphone
Beautiful gray color for my iphone 6 white.,497,iphone
"This product is faulty.  I have been advised by Apple that the product is a fraud.  Faulty screen, damaged cosmetic features (camera lens), vibrate function doesn't work.",498,iphone
Excellent Phone and Great price. Highly recommendable!!!!,499,iphone
So far came as described my son was very satisfied I just got it but so far so good <U+0001F60A>,500,iphone

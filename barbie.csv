"Everything looked like it should. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because not all of the hardware was in the box to put it together, so we had to find items that would work.",1,barbie
My daughter loves her new house.. Its a definite upgrade from her last house. It has everything you can possibly dream of!,2,barbie
"Easy to set up(couple hours),very detailed.I wish I could have a toy like this when I was little:)",3,barbie
The kid is nuts about this big ugly thing!,4,barbie
Great,5,barbie
Well its about a year later house is still fine. Elevator broke probably girls fault. Many pieces are lost lol but they still enjoy playing with it. Paired it with barbie car and its a set.An example of great quality barbie car than can hold 30 lb 2 year old girl. I know she is a heavy one hahhaha.,6,barbie
My daughter loves!!! this doll house! It took her forever to put it together but she loves it! It<U+2019>s HUGE!!! A great buy Amazon saved the day!! I called all around and everyone was sold out! It<U+2019>s been two months now and all the pieces still work! Lol she<U+2019>s (we<U+2019>re) having lots of fun!,7,barbie
this house is as tall as my granddaughter. She loves it . She puts her Barbie and friends in it  and creates stories about their visit to the dreamhouse.. It is beautiful also. This. is why I love it. It inspires her imagination..,8,barbie
Excellent! Very impressed!,9,barbie
Perfect! Didn<U+2019>t take too long to put together and we had as much fun doing that as my niece has playing with it.,10,barbie
Kids love it but wish the quality was a little better. Keep having to reattach the elevator. I tell the kids to have Barbie use the stairs instead!,11,barbie
House is great. One problem: elevator usually has problems when you try to get it up,12,barbie
Beautiful house! My daughter loved it!,13,barbie
This toy was a matter of great satisfaction to my granddaughter!!!,14,barbie
"easy to assemble, and good quality. daughters love it",15,barbie
This thing is SO COOL.  I would have killed to have something like this as a kid!,16,barbie
Horrible to put together but other than that my daughter loves it.,17,barbie
My husband gave me this for Christmas and I loved it. Took a bit of time to put the furniture together but it was easy. My girlfriends were so jealous  I played with it all day like I was a kid. But I<U+2019>m almost 50.,18,barbie
My daughter loved it! Christmas was her favorite,19,barbie
Originally was gonna get the talking Barbie dream house. Glad that I heard it wasn't the rave and had to have Wi-Fi to work. Which means less electronics for my little to have possession of and more imagination building. I was afraid that my little may be disappointed on Christmas. But it was the opposite. She announced Santa was awesome because this was bigger and better then the other one. So she had to have been a really good girl. It is also a hit with her friends that come. Easy to put together as well.,20,barbie
Very nice my .Daugther love it,21,barbie
Very disappointed.  Elevator broke already and garage will be next. Granddaughter complains that than Barbies are too tall to fit through door ways. She probably would have been happier if we made one out of cardboard boxes.The plastic is very fragile. Waste of money.,22,barbie
Thank you!,23,barbie
This was a gift for a sick little girl. She absolutely loved it.,24,barbie
"Purchased this for my Granddaughter for Christmas, it was the biggest box by the tree, she could hardly wait to open it and when she did she screamed with joy...a must have for your Barbie fanatic.",25,barbie
loved it,26,barbie
My granddaughter was very very excited with this Barby house.,27,barbie
"I<U+2019>m disappointed with the quality. This was the one thing my daughter wanted for her birthday and while she loves it, it is already breaking down. The elevator string broke within 6 months and the cardboard roof tops are tearing as well. The garage comes off regularly and has to be put back on its track. He one I had when I was her age (6) lasted years. We will be lucky to get a year out of this one. I wish we would have gone with a wooden one. I just wanted to get her this more classic one. Lesson learned.",28,barbie
"Fast shipping.  Directions were fair, I had to keep looking at the picture. I'm glad I waited until after Christmas and paid less.  I would not have been pleased if I had to pay full price.",29,barbie
Excellent Product!,30,barbie
"This reproduction Dream House is just like the original I had as a child. I had bought two in the past on eBay looking for one in this good of shape. So thrilled Mattel brought this back. Simply love it. You will have to assemble the furniture, which I have not done yet but it looks easy enough, plus it comes with a Barbie as well. Great buy!",31,barbie
Granddaughter loved it!,32,barbie
"Daughter loved it, plays with it every day but only had it a month before the string for the elevator got tied up and won<U+2019>t work",33,barbie
Very easy to put together and very big... My 4 year old loves it!,34,barbie
"Alot of assembly for the ""elves"" directions could be a little better ... daughter loved it !!",35,barbie
My daughter loves it,36,barbie
My niece loves it.,37,barbie
Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She was thrilled with it. Easy to snap pieces.,38,barbie
As expected,39,barbie
Extremely easy to put together!,40,barbie
"Never had one as a girl, but it sure did bring back a lot of memory",41,barbie
excelente,42,barbie
"Everything there and easy to set up, only problem is I had the option for a plain brown box which I thought was awesome because it was a Christmas present for my daughter. But when it arrived it was in a brown box and had Barbie all over the box so needless to say it kinda ruined the surprise. She was still happy though.",43,barbie
My Granddaughter lives it,44,barbie
My granddaughter received this for Christmas and she loves it.,45,barbie
Was perfect and beautiful,46,barbie
Beautiful!!,47,barbie
"Granddaughter loves this Dreamhouse! The only down fall was the elevator broke next day, but this was remedied by supplier the next few days",48,barbie
my daughter's favorite toy!,49,barbie
"Got it for my 7yr old for Christmas she loves it.  Played with it all day Christmas day and still plays with it every night. I would only change one thing the fish tank, bathroom and latern are all the same thing all work on the same piece with the running water sound, lights etc... so you have to switch it around. You can't play with it all at once",50,barbie
It turned out fine.,51,barbie
My granddaughter love that the price and the speedy delivery time,52,barbie
"It arrived to our home with one of the interlocking pieces broken. The elevator gets stuck every now and then. Other, than that my daughter enjoys it.",53,barbie
My granddaughter loves it she has spent hours playing with it very happy,54,barbie
My granddaughter loves it some of the moving parts don<U+2019>t stay in place like the garage door.,55,barbie
It came with a lot of pieces  furniture etc but it is made out plastic ;but my granddaughter really enjoys it a lot,56,barbie
It's a great doll house. Came with everything. Instructions were easy to follow. It's real sturdy.,57,barbie
"Everything was goodWhen we opened the box , the pool that goes on the side was brokeIf you could ship that part that would be great",58,barbie
My granddaughter loves it,59,barbie
Beautiful!!,60,barbie
Great quality doll house.  It was surprisingly easy to put together for how many pieces it has.  It has held up well and that includes an hour drive in the back of a jeep all put together!,61,barbie
"This was pretty easy to assemble, however, you do have to be careful with the elevator as it is not very durable and easily breaks or becomes unattached. My 5 YO daughter is very easy on toys, but knows she has to be careful with certain parts of the dreamhouse otherwise they may break. She really does love playing with it.",62,barbie
I really thought it was bigger and we thought we bought the doll house we thought it was the other one that have voice command,63,barbie
Daughter plays with this daily. Absolutely loves it.,64,barbie
"the elevator broke after a few weeks, but daughter still enjoys playing with it. It is HUGE!",65,barbie
I was a little worried it would be hard to put together but it was not at all! Took two of us only about an hour. It is absolutely adorable and my little girl loves it!,66,barbie
Great gift and only two took hours to put up.  My husband videoed the construction of it stating we had to beat the timeframe of friends of ours who encouraged us to get this for our daughter.  Two downsides: 1) the elevator keeps getting jam as the string that controls it is inside so can't reach in to fix it and 2) hosting lots of playdates as all her friends want to play with it.,67,barbie
"I HATE barbies with passion, but I have to say, for the cheap plastic house, this one is well designed and fun.It's been a month, but nothing is broken so far.Garage door design is clever, but doesn't work as well as it looks...Oh well, you can't expect much from Mattel.My 9 year old daughter had fun putting this together with my not so ""handy"" husband.",68,barbie
Our 3 year old daughter loves this and plays with it daily. It was super easy to set up.,69,barbie
"Daughter loves it, though the string for the elevator kept coming off, it needs some trimming to keep it tight.",70,barbie
"This was a hit on Christmas morning. My husband and I put it together before hand, and it took about an hour, and that included putting the stickers on. Great quality",71,barbie
Didn't realize it was so large but the grandchildren love it. I think they forgot about the other toys in the playroom. Well worth the cost.,72,barbie
"My daughter loves it but for the price it feels flimsy and cheaply made. The elevator doesn't work right, the garage door gets stuck and the oven\dishwasher doors fall off. I don't see this lasting long.",73,barbie
Granddaughter loves it!,74,barbie
This thing is HUGE! My daughter loves it and no problems with the elevator thus far. Only complaint is there are SO many tiny pieces!,75,barbie
"My daughter loves this and it was easy to assemble as all the pieces snap on. The elevator was working fine but after about a month of being used, it doesn't go all the way to the top as it used to.. it is just a tad off. But daughter doesn't care so i guess it's all good!",76,barbie
A prefect gift for my niece she loves it.,77,barbie
Easy to put togeather. Child loved it. Came within days of ordering.,78,barbie
Perfect my 4 year old loves it !,79,barbie
I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. She loves it & plays with it almost every day. It's of good quality & a nice size too.,80,barbie
The only thing I have to say is a bit large to wrap. But I used 2 rolls of wrapping paper. Other than that product meets all expectations.,81,barbie
"Pain to put together to be honest. Lots of stickers and lots of VERY small pieces. Once put together, it can be moved but not easily. Very tall.",82,barbie
All the pieces were in the box. Very easy to put together. My 4 year old daughter was very happy with the house. She plays with it everyday.,83,barbie
My girls haven't stopped playing with it,84,barbie
"my daughters love the dream house, comes with tons of accessories and its a great size. easy to move around if needed and putting together was a breeze!! totally recommend it!!",85,barbie
"This is way too expensive, too difficult to put together, and had no challenges for kids.",86,barbie
"Daughter loves it and it<U+2019>s so cute! Much more accessible than the last dream house they came out with. At first assembly looked intimidating, but it was pretty easy once I started.",87,barbie
"Apparently this is every little girls dream toy. I have nightmares of fixing this damn thing every time she plays with it.  Only reason it got 2 stars is because she loves it and it was reasonably easy to put together. The elevator  system is on a string with pulleys at each end. The string always falls off the pulleys. So you have to take apart and put the string back on. The garage door comes off track and is in a bind every time you try to open it.  The only plus out of this damn thing is that I'm a hero because I can fix it. Seriously my little girl has nicknamed me ""Handy Dandy Daddy"".For all the fixers out there remove the pillar at the top right. Then remove screw that is at the top/inside then all you have to do is fish that string back onto the center of the pulley.  Happy Fixing!!",88,barbie
The house arrived dirty and untidy.,89,barbie
Daughter loves it. Simple to assemble,90,barbie
Bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas. This is all she talked about for months before Christmas. We got this as her <U+201C>Santa<U+201D> gift. We built it the night before and it had two broken parts! Pretty disappointing,91,barbie
"The Elevator Shaft came damaged .we cant take it back ,the dream house is Sanat's gift to my 4 year old.we need new elevator shaft for the barbie house ,but we dont have the option online to make the exchange",92,barbie
This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it!!!,93,barbie
Excellent,94,barbie
"My granddaughter loved it! It came with so many accessories, each room is so cute. It has a working elevator which she had me take a ride on being that she was giving me the grand tour while we were doing FaceTime on her Moms phone. I just glad she<U+2019>s using her own imagination and taking time a break from video games and you tube!",95,barbie
Granddaughter LOVES it <3,96,barbie
It was identical to the one I received as a child....thanks for brining this back!,97,barbie
My 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas and adores it. She plays with it every day. It<U+2019>s pretty sturdy and easy for her to use. I know this is something she will get years of play out of.,98,barbie
"Easy to put together, and the kids love playing with it.",99,barbie
SUPER easy to put together!!!! This was one happy mom on Christmas Eve lol,100,barbie
I<U+2019>m amazed by how easy this doll house was to put togeather. No tools required! I had it built in less than 30 minutes. My daughtes love it.,101,barbie
Arrived on time.  It was easy to assemble and I like the quality of the furniture.,102,barbie
"<U+00A0>Really disappointed, after having spent nearly $200 with taxes on this i was expecting a high quality product. The elevator broke within days and in order to fix it you have to tip over the entire dream house , spill the contents on the floor and fix the poorly designed cheap ribbon pulley system which comes back of the tracks within a day of play.My daughter is super gentle with her toys for a five year old so if it<U+2019>s breaking with her I would imagine it breaks with most kids.The other exciting features also don<U+2019>t work properly (video included) this is super disappointing. I scrimped and saved to buy this toy and the features that attracted my daughter to it don<U+2019>t work properly.",103,barbie
We did not get any of the stickers and didn<U+2019>t get most of the attachments furniture and the pieces to put it all together. Many pieces missing.,104,barbie
Easy to assemble,105,barbie
My daughter loves it. Assembly was reasonably easy. Be warned though. It's huge!!!,106,barbie
Incredible details but still easy to assemble. It only took 20-30 minutes and it was ready for play time. My three year old daughter loved it and plays with it daily.,107,barbie
This was a thrill for my granddaughter to get on Christmas morning. She plays with it everyday.,108,barbie
easy to install but arrived late,109,barbie
Loved it!!!,110,barbie
My doughter plays a lot with the dreamhouse. I love it because it take her out of television or tablets. She loves it!,111,barbie
Much easier to put together than anticipated. Daughter enjoyed all the little extras that came with it. Make sure to have batteries and a screwdriver on hand for assembly,112,barbie
"This house is a beautiful replica of the first Barbie dream house. It is made of very sturdy cardboard, but it still looks good enough for displaying. The doll that comes with is exquisite. Great product for adult collectors for the price. Highly recommend.",113,barbie
Don<U+2019>t think I got my money worth all I bought a lot wasn<U+2019>t what I thought paid a lot aquilty was not that good,114,barbie
It was the hit of Christmas for my 4 year old daughter who absolutely loved it,115,barbie
Received this with broken parts. The garage door does not stay on. It keeps falling off the tracks even when you're not trying to open it. So disappointed.,116,barbie
"Although daughter loves the dollhouse and secretly wished for it, product is alright. Lots of plastic that seems thin and not durable to last a long time. Disappointed the manufacture incorporated black accents into design. There is only 1 piece of furniture that interchanges with several pieces that enables the electronic mechanism. That is very disappointing as you have to change the pieces when those pieces belong in different parts of the dollhouse. Why would the manufacture design it this way? No bottom to garage either. Very disappointed and not worth the money, even if on sale.",117,barbie
"Assembly was easy, no missing or damaged parts. The build quality is what you would expect. I had a problem with the elevator (the string kept coming off of the pulleys, but an adjustment to the string length helped) but no other issues.",118,barbie
"Unfortunately it came with a broken piece!  I'm noticing g this as I'm assembling the 3rd floor parlor.  Also,  the decal that came affixed is also crooked.  Not tearing this apart now.  Guess I'll use duct tape!!!",119,barbie
Wicked easy to put together.  my 6 year old loves it.,120,barbie
My little girls love this and play with it for hours!!,121,barbie
box was damaged but nothing broke.,122,barbie
Great product.  My daughter love it. Easy to assemble,123,barbie
"For the price it is not worth it, but as most of us buying this I have a daughter who wanted this for Christmas so I had to buy it basically. It is pretty impressive out together and she loves it. I assembled it Christmas Eve and it took a little over an hour. I would expect it to take anywhere from 1 to 2 1/2 hours to put together. I watch a YouTube video and it really sped the process up for me. Materials are sturdy and moving parts on the elevator work well. It is large and lots of rooms to play with. Overall it is a great product with hefty price tag, if you have to buy it your daughter will be happy.",124,barbie
"We bought the Barbie Dreamhouse for my granddaughter for Christmas,she love it until the elevator stop working. We are afaraid to get another it might do the same thing.",125,barbie
It came in perfect condition. My daughter loves it. Hours of playtime.,126,barbie
"I<U+2019>m quite embarrassed to admit that I spent as much money on this item, considering the quality. This was the only item my daughter received for the holidays and as we were unboxing, I noticed that some of the decals were missing. But I figured they<U+2019>re stickers, no biggie. While putting the house together you must be gentle as the plastic itself is thin, not at all sturdy like it used to be. The track for the garage is either warped or the pieces were just not designed properly because the garage door sticks when attempting to open it. Semi-functional but not fun. The tiny button on top of the toilet is hit or miss as far as function. After being gently pressed the button gets stuck and releases slowly, no sound or delayed sound. Just cheaply made. All of this still didn<U+2019>t deter my daughter from loving this hot pink house of her dreams. She did however express a fair bit of disappointment (tears) when we went to put the elevator together and the string that runs through the elevator shaft was off track from the pulley...making the elevator non-functional. I was able to find a fix for the elevator on YouTube, so obviously this is a common issue with this model Barbie house. I will try to work on the repair today and post an update. This item would<U+2019>ve been promptly returned if it weren<U+2019>t for the fact that my daughter asked that I not. I am not at all pleased and implore anyone looking to purchase this item to wait until there<U+2019>s a significant markdown in price. Spend a bit more money on one of the sturdier collectors Dreamhouse models from the 90s, or purchase a wooden doll house (Sams Club had a nice one), or buy a pet rock (more functional than this dream house). The beautiful colors and nostalgia are not at all worth the price tag for this model.",127,barbie
"We purchased this house for my 5year old daughter. It was super easy to click together. Only really a screw drivers needed. The stickers where the time consuming part. And the little flower brackets that hold the cloth in the bedroom would not stay on the wall. They wouldn't click into play. But a little glue fixed that. (Very minor) The elevator is a smooth operator! It flawlessly glideds up and down. Which she loves. The one in her old house was so hard and always stuck. The garage door does get stuck some. But she has learned a trick to get it up and down and doesn't seem to mind. WOW the accessories it comes with are great. We were missing a few though , like the black tray the turkey sits on. So check your packaging. I will say that the interchangable cabinet for the bathroom/grill/fish tank... Is annoying. No kid likes to have to remove the toilet and sink so Barbie can grill!!!! What if a guest needs to use the bathroom and your grilling. LOL <U+0001F602>.. So basically she leaves it as a bathroom. And doesn't use the other two pieces,which is a bummer. I hope they change this feature in the long run. It was a great idea but not well thought out. Oh and the house is HUGE!! IT is taller than my 5yr old!!! So make sure you have room. Over all we have had so much fun with this doll house. I can see it lasting many years!!",128,barbie
"I absolutely love the Dream house. My kiddos who received if for Christmas loved it, however I do not think it is worth the price. The price for what you get is to high. It is well made, the garage, elevator work perfectly, the garage will fit a small car, but not the remote control corvet it's to long.  The colors are nice, the design could have been a bit better thought out. The one design issue is the elevator, now it works perfectly but placement is odd. There is only one way you can place furniture or you block the elevator exit/entrance limiting creativity of the child. The other issue is, not many accessories or not enough for what you pay. The accessories you do get are nice, just not many. I like the 3 story design is nice, the width and length is good. It dose not take up a lot of space which is great when working with limited space. Over all it's a Wonderful Barbie house, looks Beautiful, well made, all moving parts work perfect, and it doesn't take up much space. Down side elevator placement and the price for what you get. I had a gift card so I only paid out of pocket 100. I would give it 3 in a half stars, but that's not an option on the rating.",129,barbie
6yo is in absolute heaven. Fairly easy to put together if you follow instructions. The only issue we<U+2019>ve had is that on the back side of the elevator the plastic is buckling inward where the white piece attaches to the elevator body. It doesn<U+2019>t have anything to do with attaching the elevator to the structure itself. She doesn<U+2019>t mind it- I just hope it doesn<U+2019>t affect the functionality of the elevator ling-term.,130,barbie
Easy to assemble and was the perfect surprise for my 4yr old! She plays endless hours upon hours using her imagination! Only complaint is the little pink curtain holders pop off like crazy as does the elvevator doors and the oven door. Ugh. But still 5 stars since I would have been in heaven having this when I was a little one. I love seeing my daughter so happy!,131,barbie
It's Barbie's dreamhouse what can I say or what is there to say. When I was a kid growing up there was a saying I want to be like Barbie the girl has everything!,132,barbie
"Incredible doll house my daughter plays for hours, easy to put together and very sturdy. A win-win",133,barbie
Item arrived damaged. Looked like someone had attempted to assemble it and gave up after damaging the pieces.,134,barbie
"Great product, easy to put together!",135,barbie
The product is great but is too expensive,136,barbie
"My daughter has wanted this for so long and so disappointing as 1 of the rollers for the garage door is missing, toilet doesn't work and plastic glass window was broken.The time window to return was November 16th and purchased for Christmas.",137,barbie
granddaughter loves it.,138,barbie
"This is a beautiful dream house, but one of the pieces was broken when I received it.  The plastic piece that the elevator slides on was broken at the top, so when my daughter uses the elevator and wants it to go to the top, the elevator will come off.  It almost appeared as if this product was returned, because some of the packaging inside the box was loose and not secured properly.  I WAS NOT HAPPY AT ALL about this considering how much this dream house cost!  >:(  Other than that, she loves it, and is having a lot of fun with it.  It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble it.  I would appreciate some of my money back for the damaged part!!!!",139,barbie
"<U+00A0>This dream house is everything I would<U+2019>ve wanted when I was a child. Keeps my girls busy, they love the different accessories and sounds!",140,barbie
I received the house but there are a lot pieces missing. There are stickers and extra parts of little furniture that were not included in the package. I am very disappointed. Hopefully someone will be able to take care of this matter as soon as possible.,141,barbie
Detailed and helps imagination run wild. Granddaughter absolutely loves it. Hrs and hrs of fun,142,barbie
They came with no instructions not in the Barbie doll box and did not have the stickers oh no it<U+2019>s all right for my baby girl,143,barbie
"This dream house is very nice.  My girls enjoy this dream house and the accessories and little details make it that much more beautiful.  I personally wish I had this dream house as a little girl.  Flushing toilet, tv, canopy bed, chandelier, and the list goes on.  However, for $164 the quality of this dream house is very poor.  It's flimsy and the garage is very stiff and does not go up smoothly.  Day 2 and the elevator already doesn't work.  We have a 7 year old Kidkraft kitchen and doll house that is still standing strong and we paid about $164 for both combined.It took about 2 hours to put it all together which was not at all difficult.  I was hesitant to order the dream house based on some reviews stating the poor quality but my daughter really wanted it for Christmas.  I'll definitely stick to Kidskraft in the future.",144,barbie
It wasn't too hard to assemble and it is good quality. My daughter loves playing with it. It comes with all the bells and whistles too- the sounds effects and lights. A worth while purchase.,145,barbie
My daughter LOVES it,146,barbie
Garage and elevator is broken.,147,barbie
Missing the bathtub.  Ugh...of course my daughter noticed.,148,barbie
my daughter is thoroughly enjoying this barbie mansion. it was extremely easy to put together and comes with all the accessories.,149,barbie
My Grandkids love it. Hope it holds up. So far having problems with Garage door.,150,barbie
"Hours and hours of fun. This is a great purchase. I watched a YouTube video of how to put it together and it didn't take very long. Everything snaps together and it was pretty much a breeze. We did have an issue with the sound/lights on the smart furniture not working, but a quick call to Mattell and they rectified the situation. Overall, my girls are going to get years of fun out of this toy and I'm impressed with it. Very few details are left out. It came with loads of accessories too. I highly reccomend this for anybody that likes Barbie",151,barbie
<U+00A0>Bought this for my daughter<U+2019>s Christmas and after putting it together realized the elevator doesn<U+2019>t work,152,barbie
I<U+2019>m crazy about this house I really want play with it all day long - guess what ??? Barbie and her fiends actually fits in the house soooooo awsome my daughter is In loooooooooove,153,barbie
"Along with her barbie dolls and baby alive, this dream house is awesome to her. U can't tell her nothing she had a great Christmas, and I'm the greatest grand pa to her.",154,barbie
Super easy to put together,155,barbie
My almost 8 year old loves it! It took about 2 hours to put together.,156,barbie
Awesome,157,barbie
Paid a lot for this and it came in a bigger box than I see in the stores. Also the elevators must have been packed in a weird angle because one side is bent and it does not work as it should.,158,barbie
"My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this. She woke up this morning, on Christmas, and saw that Santa had left her what she wished for!",159,barbie
I paid a lot of money to have the garage door broken when putting it together for my sister. Its missing a piece on the door and it's not able to be used at all. Basically I have a doll house with a big empty square with no garage door.,160,barbie
"It do not fit, very bad.",161,barbie
Elevator broke in 5 mins disappointing,162,barbie
"I was so excited to give this to my daughter, I remember getting my dreamhouse,  well it was disappointing,  pieces we're broken and it has to be sent back.",163,barbie
This thing is garbage compared to an earlier model.. No shower....the toilet attaches to the stove? Really?? It's just a big house...no interaction..none...no door bell...no singing in the shower...no crackling fireplace...if you have an older model Keep it...big waste of money...I have a 10yr old dream house that's 10 times as nice..another example of companies looking at profits instead of what consumers want...disappointed,164,barbie
I purchased this item for my daughter as a gift from Santa. My daughter was ecstatic upon opening her gift and seeing that Santa brought her a Barbie Dream House. Something she has wanted for some time. We began to open the box for assembly and discovered that there were quite a few pieces that were broken. Now I have to explain to my daughter that we have to return her gift from Santa because it is broken. Very disappointed little girl.,165,barbie
I was Upset when my daughter opened her Barbie dream house one of the walls were broken the toilet won<U+2019>t flush the garage door doesn<U+2019>t it open and shut like it should was not pleased with this item especially for the price I paid for it,166,barbie
"Perfect Christmas gift for my 5 year old! This house was an absolute breeze to put together - no screws needed, everything just snaps together. It<U+2019>s a nice size and has the most adorable accessories. I added some string lights myself for the big reveal! I highly recommend.",167,barbie
"Went to you tube for help to put it together since there were no directions in the box.  There<U+2019>s no box actually or original packaging.  A couple parts are missing then there are other parts that do t belong. I think it<U+2019>s a used product. Bit such a bad thing, but would have like to know this prior.",168,barbie
Came without original box from manufacturer without the bag of stickers or linens for barbies bed.  Not pleased.,169,barbie
"My daughter is in love with this dollhouse. We got the car also, which is sold separately. Very happy with the purchase.",170,barbie
Just like the picture. Really nice.,171,barbie
Was so excited for this for my daughter for Christmas. Unfortunately it came out of the box broken and the return date already expired?? Not a cheap toy to come broken. Think twice before ordering online,172,barbie
"I opened the box last night, and the plastic columns are broken. I<U+2019>ll have to somehow set it up so its under the tree, but will need to replace it after Christmas",173,barbie
"Pieces of the house came damaged, and some pieces were missing. Very disappointed, will not be ordering anything this important again (was for my 6 yr old daughter's christmas)",174,barbie
"The house set was missing an interactive table, advertised on the package as <U+201C>new furniture!<U+201D> The leaflet inside the box refers to it as a piece that should have been included, and there are two decals that were provided that should have gone with the table. It was one of two tables that takes three AAA batteries to operate sounds and lights. I don<U+2019>t know how to contact the seller to mitigate this issue. We didn<U+2019>t notice it missing until the end of assembly when we were applying the decals.Edit: There is only one table that requires batteries. It looked to me like there were supposed to be two, but it<U+2019>s really just the backside of the bathroom counter that is supposed to double as a grill, fan stand, aquarium stand, etc. My daughter is happy and so am I.",175,barbie
"Great looking barbie house. Lots of cool little things, like the working elevator and the garage that opens like a real garage door. Unfortunately the quality control was a bit lacking - the dishwasher is broken and does not stay shut at all, and one of the white plastic tabs that attach the roof to the dollhouse came broken off. Also the smartphone holder (TV) is too small to fit any of the phones in our house (not a deal breaker but just something to be aware of).",176,barbie
"Came in time, easy assembly do not be overwhelmed when you open the box. The only thing I can say is look at the picture of the fully assemble item first before attempting it. Place the stickers first before you begin the assembly.",177,barbie
This item is great but it came with a broken piece! I just opened it up to set up and surprise my baby for her bday tomorrow and now Idk what to do,178,barbie
"This was to be Santa<U+2019>s big gift as is tradition in my house he gives one big present each year. I selected to conceal the packaging for this item so as to not give away what was in it because my six year old can read. This was the package that came, and yes she read it, so now I am at a loss as to what to do or how to explain it away and overall disappointed that I have to create a story when it all could<U+2019>ve been avoided in the first place.",179,barbie
Awesome product! My kids love it,180,barbie
"Well, my granddaughter loved it but the elevator broke the first day and the next day the toilet quit working. Sad to pay so much and it is breaking so soon. She<U+2019>s not that hard on her toys",181,barbie
"Elevator broke in less than 3 hours of play. The parts are flimsy and thin. Absolute junk, I would recommend passing on this dollhouse and looking into another brand completely.",182,barbie
Too tall needs to be a little shorter but wider.,183,barbie
It was easy to put together after I watched a YouTube video! But there are a lot of parts. My girls LOVE it!!!,184,barbie
AWFUL! Did not come in a Barbie box did not have directions! DO NOT BUY! LOOKS USED! Missing pieces too!,185,barbie
My 6 year old daughter loves this! Beautiful and sturdy!,186,barbie
In the pictures it says that the dream house would arrive in plain box so to not give away what it was. Arrived in big Barbie dream house box. Surprise was ruined. Not happy,187,barbie
Luxury Barbie house. It takes some time to build but worth the effort.,188,barbie
she really loved it,189,barbie
My daughter loves her barbie house and was one of the best purchases so far for her 4th birthday!,190,barbie
I<U+2019>ve waited 2 years before purchasing this Barbie dream house for my 6th year old and finally bought this for her. She loves Barbie and everything about it. I have not yet took it out the box but I cannot wait to build it and put it together and gave it ready for her to play when she unwraps it. More review to come after Xmas.,191,barbie
My daughter plays for hours with this! She<U+2019>s in love. Obviously occasionally things fall off but for the most part built nice for the price. Would buy again!,192,barbie
Excellent,193,barbie
"It loos exactly like it does in the advert. After putting it together, it looks like it will fall apart when my granddaughter plays with it, so we will see on Christmas Day morning when she opens it.",194,barbie
Thank you I got it just waiting on my other stuff,195,barbie
Is a Christmas present and was not in original box,196,barbie
My daughter loves it so i love it and being that my other daughter has the Barbie house that you can talk to they get best of both worlds when my younger daughter comes over to play with her brother and sister,197,barbie
"Easy to assemble, and keeps the girls busy for hours.",198,barbie
Pretty doll house but I have missing pieces,199,barbie
"You purchased this item on December 7, 2017. Style: Brown Box, No Branded Exterior  |  View this orderI cut and paste the above from my order history.Thank you so much for delivering it in a ""brown box"" with BARBIE DREAMHOUSE printed all over the ""no branded exterior""... REALLY!!!Oh and of course my daughter saw it on the front porch when she arrived home from school.I ordered it in the ""Brown Box, No Branded Exterior"" because I knew I would not be able to get to it before she arrived home.Thanks so much.",200,barbie
I'm really disappointed that the pieces were removed from the Barbie box and put in a cardboard box.... Now when my child opens her gift she won't even know what it is... Why the heck would Amazon take the pieces out of the original Barbie house box... Very disappointing.,201,barbie
"Great value! It<U+2019>s easy to put together, but takes some time. Lots of little pieces so keep away from small ones. Endless amounts of fun for your kids and gets their imagination going. If it<U+2019>s a gift, be sure to purchase on amazon packaging  the regular box comes with the picture on the side.",202,barbie
"A seven year-old's dream come true!  My granddaughter  and I had fun putting the easy to assemble house together.  She loved all the stickers for the house and the extra accessories.  However, we never could get the garage door to work properly.",203,barbie
Product was very easy to put together.  Between the directions and using utube it was not a problem at all.,204,barbie
great product,205,barbie
The fan and fish tank don't work elevator was all bent up and cracks throughout the frame of the house I would never buy this again,206,barbie
Came very quickly and very satisfied,207,barbie
"Nice Barbie house, but kind of cheaply made. The elevator didn't work so we sent it back for a replacement. The new one came in damaged so we just got out money back.",208,barbie
"Very disappointed in the shipping box! This was a Christmas present for my daughter. When it arrived, it was in a brown box with Barbie Dream House all over the outside.",209,barbie
Great item fast shipping,210,barbie
"Made  well, but totally disappointed thinking that it was going to make more noises. It's very limited on what it actually does, but my daughter still like it.",211,barbie
"Product page states ""brown box, no branded exterior"".  However, it clearly has the product name written on the side of the box!Buyer beware, don't have it delivered if your child can read!  I'm lucky my son didn't see his sister's present, otherwise he would've told her and the magic of Santa would be gone.",212,barbie
"When it came it was covered in dust. I washed it off 3 times and still looked dirty. Brought it into the house and when I put it on the floor, dust came out everywhere. I mean everywhere. Need to put wrap over it of some sort. <U+0001F615>",213,barbie
"The plastic are damaged for $150.00 this is inexcusable, unprofessional, not acceptable.",214,barbie
Buy the product in new condition and I got used and with broken pieces,215,barbie
"I paid extra for the unmarked box to avoid people being tempted to steal my giant package and to avoid spoiling the surprise for my child. However, the more expensive <U+201C>blank<U+201D> box still has the Barbie branding and says dream house in large letters on the side. What did I pay $10 extra for?!?",216,barbie
This was supposed to be an unmarked box and was not. I am very upset because this was supposed to be my daughters Christmas gift and she saw it!,217,barbie
Great product is as describe and fast shippinh,218,barbie
I purchased this a year ago for Christmas and my Daughter still loves and plays with this Doll house almost every day. The product is pretty durable despite my two year old son<U+2019>s handy work! Great Purchase.,219,barbie
Gave this as a birthday gift and the birthday girl is obsessed!  Lots of fun and hours and hours of playtime.,220,barbie
Excellent toy. Thanks. Great service.,221,barbie
Perfect Christmas present I know my daughter will have a blast,222,barbie
Wonderful!!! The house os bigger than I thought and my daugther loved the size is the same of her.,223,barbie
"This is a Christmas present so it's not fully assembled yet. However, I had to take it out of the box because even though I ordered the brown bow, no branded...it still says on the box exactly what is in the box, along with with Barbie logo. So, if your child can read or knows the logo, hide the box!!!  Dollhouse is plastic, so not sure how long it will last...but it will all be worth the happiness on Christmas.",224,barbie
"Missing parts, unable to assemble for my daughter on Christmas",225,barbie
"I am extremely upset. After literally saving and saving for several months to FINALLY and BARELY be able to afford this dream house for my daughter (after she begged for it last year, but I just couldn't afford to buy it for her and I was heartbroken), within just HOURS of submitting this order, the price dropped! I could've bought it a while back if it were the new price. I understand irony for sure, but I feel this was deceitful. Wish I could get a credit for the difference since it was very well within 24 hours.",226,barbie
"I haven<U+2019>t even opened the box yet, but it was supposed to be a brown box with no indication of what<U+2019>s inside. Well it says Barbie right on the box! My daughter is 5 and can<U+2019>t read very many words, but she knows the Barbie symbol. <U+0001F644> A little disappointed in the description.",227,barbie
"I'd rate in 0 stars, if I could.  Santa brought this to us.  We greatly appreciate his nice thought, but unfortunately this is overpriced junk.  Save your money.  Either make something out of wood or boxes or buy a vintage house off of ebay or at a garage sale.  After a week, the elevator broke so now the elevator has to be lifted up and down by hand while squeezing the buttons; if I had a receipt I would have been calling with complaints and asking for replacements.  About a month ago the garage door and elevator broke completely off; I just not got it figured out how to fix them.  However, the elevator is broke like it was days after Santa gave it to us, and the garage door is difficult to open and close.  I have thought about calling Barbie and complaining, but I'd doubt it would do any good because people will just keep buying their overpriced house.",228,barbie
My daughters eyes lit up when this was set up so worth it.,229,barbie
I got this for Christmas a few years ago but it is a blast! There is so many accessories and things to do with this dream house the fun never ends! The elavator and garage at rall cool.,230,barbie
"I got this for my daughter's 5th Birthday. It was super easy to put together (manual is in color) the box was all brown with just Barbie written small in one of the corners, but it was perfect! She's been nonstop playing with it!",231,barbie
"I haven<U+2019>t opened it. It<U+2019>s a Christmas present for my granddaughter. It arrived with the box all smooshed on one side, not precisely the beautiful package I wanted for her.",232,barbie
"Great. This was supposed to be a Christmas present in a <U+201C>no branded, brown box<U+201D> had the stupid Barbie logo on it and said Barbie dreamhouse on the outside of it too. My child has now seen the box, which had he barbie logo on it. You guys literally just ruined my Christmas present for her.",233,barbie
My daughter loves the dream house. However the item came with a defect because the elevator is non functional. Huge disappointment for my daughter if we have to dismantle the house to return it. It was her birthday present and she was super excited to receive it.,234,barbie
Good house,235,barbie
My goddaughter is in love!,236,barbie
"Box arrived, product is perfectly fine. I ordered the brown box not branded so my little one wouldn't see. And the barbie branded box showed up. Be careful when ordering with kids in the house.",237,barbie
Thanks,238,barbie
"Although this has nothing to do with the actual product, I ordered this for my daughter as a surprise.  Chose the option of being delivered in a brown box thinking that my daughter wouldn<U+2019>t see it- although no picture on it- said large on the side <U+201C>Barbie Dream House.<U+201D>  She saw it- surprise ruined.  <U+0001F61E>",239,barbie
It<U+2019>s a hit with our 4 year old! The imaginary play is endless!,240,barbie
"My 3 year old granddaughter loved this gift for her birthday! Gave her a couple Barbie dolls too, but she played with her Daniel Tiger figurines and Mickey Mouse figurines in it at first.  She loved the elevator - called it a roller coaster, going up and down over and over. LOL. Her mom put in her cell phone in the TV slot and put a movie on. So cute! I think she'll get lots of use out of it.",241,barbie
"It<U+2019>s huge and my daughter loves it, but made poorly! The elavator sticks and the garage door falls off all the time and is extremely hard to get it to easily move up and down.For the money, it should be made better.",242,barbie
My granddaughter loved it,243,barbie
Buy and assemble early.  Our house had broken pieces but we waited until the night before to assemble so had no time to return.  We glued them together and went on.  Cute house and she loves is.,244,barbie
"Eventhough it came in a plain box, all pieces arrived, it was simple to put together, very happy",245,barbie
"Kids LOVE this. Very well engineered and easy for me to assemble. No tools - snaps together.  The ability to put our Iphone 5 (Iphone 6 is too large) into the flat panel TV is a total riot.  Only complaint is having only one electronic vanity with 4 interchangeable tops (bathroom sink, stove, aquarium, fan) and my 2 kids fight over it. I<U+2019>ve emailed Mattel asking if I can purchase an additinal electronic vanity.",246,barbie
my daughter love it,247,barbie
Nice! Everything we hoped for!,248,barbie
<U+0001F44D>,249,barbie
Grand daughter loved it.,250,barbie
Got the package for my daughters 4th birthday everything seemed fine with he package and everything so i didn't think anything was wrong so my wife wrapped the gift for my daughter. When the time came she opened it and wanted to put it together. thinking nothing was wrong with the product i started to put it together and that is where i noticed that the product was damaged and parts were broken. when i told my daughter that it was broken she was heartbroken and crying so i did the best i could in putting it together so she could at least play with the item.it really hearts a father when a gift you give your child is damaged and they can't get the full enjoyment out of the product.very unsatisfied with the product and the seller,251,barbie
This is the first time I've ordered something from Amazon and been unhappy! We spent $180 on this for my daughters 6th birthday and when we opened it several parts were broken and it couldn't be put together! My daughter was heartbroken!,252,barbie
Good,253,barbie
My granddaughter was thrilled at her new Barbie dream house.  She loves it.,254,barbie
It<U+2019>s such a great dollhouse! There are so many touches. I recommend buying a Barbie car and a couple of dolls. We bought the Jeep and it fits in the garage.,255,barbie
my granddaughter loves it,256,barbie
"Still in good condition after much use, great gift",257,barbie
My granddaughter fell in love with the dream house.  She has played with it for hours.,258,barbie
"No missing parts, easy to assemble,  step by step directions. .",259,barbie
"Kind of cheap plastic, but my grandchildren love it just the same.",260,barbie
"It is huge, it<U+2019>s perfect, if you have a daughter you need to get her this. Omg it<U+2019>s every little girl<U+2019>s dream",261,barbie
"Daughter loves it!  Easy to assemble, and affordable alternative to a wooden Barbie house.  It has survived hours of play and torture!",262,barbie
My daughter loved it. Thanks,263,barbie
Easy assembly and very cute,264,barbie
"My grand daughter LOVED this, it's a very nice house",265,barbie
Product arrived new and in excellent condition.  It is a big house!!  It has provided lots of fun for the kids :),266,barbie
"Taken out of original box and dumped into plain brown box, looked less expensive but lots of tax was added on..... poor packaging very disappointed will take months to put together hoping pieces are all there there are millions and not organized so I won<U+2019>t know until last min",267,barbie
"My 5 year old loved it and its so easy to assemble, very high quality and full of fun things inside.",268,barbie
My daughter's favorite toy.  She will play for hours.  The house is interactive and fun.  Hours of imagination and play are spent on this toy.  The Barbie car fits perfectly in the garage.,269,barbie
"There's no substitute! At least not for me! My eight-year-old daughter is ecstatic over her new Dreamhouse, which is the same design my sister and I owned 40 years ago.  Easy to assemble.  It snaps together without the worry that a firm ""snap"" is going to crack/break the plastic.  Lots of really cute pieces included like the chandelier and swags, soaking bathtub, a closet with hangers!  Its a great piece that will be a big part of my kiddo's memories of playtime and imagination.",270,barbie
"My daughter loves her Barbie dreamhouse.  lol m only giving it four stars because for the price it is cheap plastic, the elevator already came off.  But she loves it and thats all that matters.",271,barbie
My granddaughter loves her Barbie house,272,barbie
"bought last Christmas. Its a pain to put together, but its pretty cool and my daughter still plays with it.",273,barbie
"The perfect gift from Santa!!!  Need I say more, it was well received!!!",274,barbie
loved it,275,barbie
"I have left this in the box so I hope everything is there. It is a Christmas present so that is why I have not opened it, however it came fast. Thank you",276,barbie
This was for my special needs Great grand daughter who turned 10 yrs old and begged for a Barbie Dreamhouse  her family could not afford it so  her aunt and I ordered it for a surprise she cried with joy when she walked into her bedroom and saw it all set up she says it was a gift from Heaven. This was worth every penny 10 xs over. Thank you from our hearts,277,barbie
"This thing is HUGE! While it is big, it's pretty hard to put together. It has held up but the elevator gives a lot of trouble going up and down and you have to manually help it up vs using the string. The garage door also gives a lot of trouble so we just leave it up or down for a while.",278,barbie
It was advertised as used but in excellent condition and it was! Like new and only about 2/3 of the cost of new. A very good buy.,279,barbie
"Your daughter will love this, note to the wise, its cheap plastic like everything now days, but my daughter loves it and thats what matters",280,barbie
Just what my daughter wanted and man it's a big house lol thank you very good business :),281,barbie
My garage door keeps jamming or the level falls off from the struggle. Is this supposed to be happening? Not good if my 3 year old has to tell me she needs help opening or fixing it. Please reply when possible. In pic shows where it gets jammed/stuck...,282,barbie
My daughter loves her barbie dream house. The only downside is the elevator can get off track and you have to mess with the rope inside. Other than that it is a very sturdy and well built house with lots of things for your child and their barbies to enjoy!,283,barbie
My granddaughter absolutely loves this!,284,barbie
girls loved it,285,barbie
Again the package I received was not to bad but of course one of the pieces were broken again and missing stickers and bedding to the Barbie house <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FD><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F> And more things next time I just might go pay the extra dollar that I was saving and buy it at the store lol,286,barbie
"great deal, but received an open box - probably someone returned. But this was not mentioned in the listing.",287,barbie
I wish I had this Barbie Dreamhouse when I was little!  Purchased for our Grandaughters 4th birthday and she will LOVE it.  The house is taller than her and with so many well thought out details. Great instructions and it was very easy for my husband and I to put together. Even the stickers were simple. I did order it in the original barbie packaging and the box was delivered by UPS in not gift giving condition. Of course Amazon has excellent customer service. We decided it is better to put it together before gifting it than just giving her a dirty or plain brown box. I highly recommend this barbie house.,288,barbie
"When put together this house is great, the pieces fit together easily. The only downside was it came in a plain brown box with all the pieces loose inside,and when given as a gift there was no photo on the box to show what's inside. The ones for sale in Walmart had a printed box showing the finnished house.",289,barbie
Me gust<U+00F3> mucho la casa,290,barbie
"This was an EXCELLENT PURCHASE for my granddaughter!!!! It was a lot of pieces but they fit together and the instructions were clear and every part was included in the box.  The house is sturdy, the pieces snapped together perfectly, it was great quality, fun colors, fun accessoreis....the sink/toilet flushing, fish tank, barbeque sounds were amazing!!! REALLY CUTE TOUCH! The garage door worked great, the elevator worked great, the decals were a bright touch...so much included!  MAKE SOME ROOM, because it is big, but easily transferable from closet to playroom.  My granddaughter loves it...and THAT is all the confirmation I need!",291,barbie
Birthday girl was so happy and enjoyed putting this toy together. Easy to follow instructions.,292,barbie
Birthday present for my 6 year old and she absolutely loves it!,293,barbie
I got this for my daughters 6th birthday and it was beyond perfect. She is obsessed!!!! So many details!,294,barbie
Perfect dream house and made of good quality material . Perfect for my 5 year old granddaughter. So much fun.,295,barbie
My nieces dream come true. Warning this house is huge but every little girls dream. It fits the barbies perfectly and easy to build.,296,barbie
"My daughter loves her Barbie Dream house. Takes some time putting it together, but it's not super hard.",297,barbie
My four year old is obsessed with Barbies and the Barbie Dreamhouse was the perfect gift for her.  The house is sturdy and provides a great place for her to use her very detailed imagination!,298,barbie
My daughter absolutely loves this little house and plays with it still all the time!  Great quality and value!,299,barbie
she loves it,300,barbie
Easy to assemble and my daughter loved it!! They could package better...there was a main connecting tab broken upon receipt but doesn't seem to affect stability. Kind of spendy for a bunch of plastic....but....what ya gonna do?,301,barbie
"This arrived in a box from Amazon not a box from Mattel. The back wall was bent, the elevator is messed up, the garage door is bent, & many of the small pieces that was supposed to be included wasn't in the box. My granddaughter is so disappointed & so am I. It's a fairly expensive toy to be junk. It should be nice for the price of the dream house.",302,barbie
"Amazing & Awesome item.Many thanks for the seller, I like your way of dealing.You makes my daughter happy with your product.Once again thank you.",303,barbie
"Perfect for a little girl that loves Barbie and has a great imagination. I purchased it for my granddaughter last Christmas, 7 yrs old and she is playing with it right now as I am writing this review. She plays with it all the time.",304,barbie
6 Yr old Daughter Loves it!!!,305,barbie
Very time consuming to put together.,306,barbie
just as expected,307,barbie
For the $ the garage and elevator need to work better! Pretty sure the elevator broke the same day we set it up. Other than that my girls love it.,308,barbie
Very nice house,309,barbie
"No screws to deal with, perfectly easy assembly...took about an hour with my little one hopping around...quality is very good. Its bigger than my almost 4 year old and she loved playing with it all day.",310,barbie
great,311,barbie
My Granddaughter loves it!,312,barbie
This Barbie Dream house was purchased for my 51 year old niece and she fell in love with it. She has collected Barbie dolls since child hood.,313,barbie
My daughters absolutely love this! It's so big I was definitely hesitant but it's worth it. Not to bad of an assembly just takes about an hour,314,barbie
excellent product,315,barbie
Bellaaaaaaa.miy bella y tiene de todo..,316,barbie
The best money I ever spent. Going on two years now of non-stop fascination with this thing. Easy to put together. Priceless time spent with my granddaughter. <3,317,barbie
"My 4 year old daughter loves it. The problem is, the garage door falls off so often that we have decided to just leave it off since my daughter becomes very frustrated with it and I get tired of continually fixing it. There is a plastic key that you need to raise and lower the garage door but it's difficult to keep the door on it's track. It is easy to put together and instructions are clear. Lots of little accessories that I keep in a ziplock bag. There are limited places to store or use accessories. There are 3 light up cabinet accessories but you can only use 1 at a time since there is only 1 cabinet. You must choose between a bathroom sink, a fan or a fish aquarium to use at one time. For the money, I feel that there should be more battery operated accessories that the child can operate.",318,barbie
got this for Christmas 2016 and my daughter loved it!,319,barbie
"Best deal out there. It's beautiful, fully furnished,  super easy to put together (took me about 40 min) and very reasonably priced.",320,barbie
"I purchased this Barbie house for my 5 year old twin granddaughters for their birthday a month ago. We put it together last night for their July 24th birthday and several items have already broken. They literally played with the house for an hour. Is everything made so cheaply in today's world that a $165.00 toy starts to break before it has been used? The garage door will not stay on the house. When you try to open the garage door the ""key"" comes out and will not stay in place. One of the chandeliers immediately broke during assembly. The elevator gets stuck and 5 year olds can barely get the Barbie in the holder. The advertisements make it look like kids have a grill, fish tank, a fan and a sink when in reality the items have to be used separately next to the attached toilet. Apparently my ""return date"" is past. Now this Barbie house is $20.00 cheaper!! Buyers beware!!! This Barbie house is cheaply made and starts to fall apart before a child even has the opportunity to play with it.",321,barbie
nice gift.,322,barbie
The instructions were very easy to follow and I was able to put the house together in under 1 hour. All of the pieces were included. It is sturdy and my daughter absolutely LOVES it!,323,barbie
Birthday present for our granddaughter.  She is glued to this toy.,324,barbie
My niece lives it .,325,barbie
Our only issue was with the smooth functionality of the elevator.,326,barbie
Elevator is bent. Some of the parts had scuff marks on them. Expected better for the price of this thing.,327,barbie
My daughter loves it.,328,barbie
"This thing is big! I purchased as a birthday present for my daughter, but all kids (boys and girls) love playing with it. The elevator is a hit. Took an hour or so to put together, but the fun is endless. Only concern is the tiny little accessories that get scattered and become a choking hazard for little ones.",329,barbie
"Well worth it, my granddaughter is very happy with her dollhouse. This is one of the first toys that I've seen her really take care of. She loves how big it is and all the amenities that comes along with it. She is very happy it does so much. I love seeing that big smile on her face when she's playing with it. I'm the best grandma now, lol.  Thanks for the prompt delivery and great price for this item.",330,barbie
Got this for Christmas for our 3 year old girl. She loves it! The pink Barbie bug convertible fits perfect in the garage.,331,barbie
Came with a missing piece. Was very disappointed with the money we had spent and a piece was missing.,332,barbie
The game is beautiful and soundBut shipped lateMy daughters enjoyed it a lot,333,barbie
LOVE THIS! My daughter is one heaven!,334,barbie

Hermosa Casa.,336,barbie
"Wow. I bought this for my Granddaughter, she wanted one like her Aunts that she saw in my Attic , which is 20 twenty years old,and still In great shape ....So with the new one she wasn't quite sure she would like it because she wanted the old one , I must say it is absolutely her favorite Gift by Far. She's 6 years old and enjoys all the interactive features. Very well made and durable,and A Gift to last a lifetime",337,barbie
"Looked cute when we got it, but the refrigerator was cracked, a roof piece was missing and the elevator doesn't work.  Very disappointingUpdate:  I took the whole thing apart packed it up and exchanged it.  Set up the new one and the elevator still doesn't work.  I don't see how this can get 5 stars, when a main function doesn't work.",338,barbie
"A little flimsy, but overall a great product.  My daughter loves it!",339,barbie
Daughter likes it but too many little pieces. Over kill.,340,barbie
Santa brought this for my 3 year old daughter. She loves it especially the pool. It does fit her Barbie car nicely.,341,barbie
"My daughter was speechless.. Easy to assemble, but does take up space. Great buy",342,barbie
My daughter dream comes true.,343,barbie
"my niece loved it, it took a while to put together but all the pieces were there and it came out looking like the picture so yay",344,barbie
Good and fantastic product thank you,345,barbie
"The doll house was assembled correctly as per instructions, but after a few weeks of light usage the garage door keeps falling off, and the elevator string and plastic attachments broke.This occurred with  light usage",346,barbie
Great product and right on time!,347,barbie
Good product,348,barbie
Will be a 6 year old birthday gift in July!,349,barbie
Elevator sort of sucks but otherwise she loves it.,350,barbie
Grand daughter loves it.  It takes a little skill and time to construct it is olver 3 feet tall,351,barbie
"I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  I wrapped it and didn't have her open it until it was past the return date.  It is missing the couch, toilet, vanity, sink, fan, fish tank, and breakfast tray.",352,barbie
My daughter was extremely happy when she woke up on her birthday to this. Very easy to put together. Came with all pieces. Very satisfied. Thank you.,353,barbie
"this dollhouse is amazing my daughter loves it!, we are both enjoying it together every thing works no problems what soever!",354,barbie
Excellent,355,barbie
"got this for a birthday gift for one granddaughter. her and sister love playing.  taller then the little one, she's 3",356,barbie
Not really worth the price. But nice product,357,barbie
"Some work to put together, but is great product!",358,barbie
"My daughter loves it so much! Pink , fab , fun... she likes every part of it! It's not available in our country (Philippines) so she had to wait for 1 1/2 months for this. Her reaction upon seeing its box was priceless. It was all worth it! I'mAlso glad that everything's working and that there were no missing pieces.  Our princess is happy, and so we are more than happy!!",359,barbie
This product was received and when opened and started to.put together a large number of pieces are broken.  It appears that the box has been opened and taped closed.  I think you should replace the product and allow me to send back the broken pieces.,360,barbie
<U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>,361,barbie
The house is great but two parts had rips in it when we bought it and the toilet was broken with two missing parts. This is bad because the toilet was supposed to make flushing sounds. It was unfortunate because the house has so many fun features. The house is great I just wasn't given a great product by the seller :(,362,barbie
Granddaughter loved this,363,barbie
My daughter loves this house.  Very happy with this purchase.,364,barbie
"Hence, some parts not fitting well like elevator, but love the flat screen TV built in for cell phone.",365,barbie
One of my favorite toys ever i got for my girls... love it,366,barbie
bought this for my daughter a year later she still is playing with it,367,barbie
Love it. My granddaughter cannot stop playing with it. She loves it.,368,barbie
she loved,369,barbie
"First time Barbie house buyer, I got the best house ever for my 10 years old daughter! She can play with all her barbies and kens, you can attached cell and play movie for her to watch with her dolls, Best Buy ever!! Easy to assemble.",370,barbie
We bought this for our 3 year old daughter and six months later it is still the centre piece of her play time. There's just so much you can do with it.,371,barbie
"Purchased for my granddaughter's 9th b-day, all parts were included which is not always the case.  Looks great and she loves it.",372,barbie
"Oh my!  What a Barbie house!  What a dream for a little girl who loves Barbie to have a house like this for her dolls!  It was everything I hoped for for our granddaughter's 5th birthday.It was simple to assemble, all the parts were there and easy to connect if you are patient.The working garage is very cute!  Make sure to buy a car!The greenhouse window/pool is adorable!The many accessories are too many to note!The spot for the working TV is just the best!  I happened to have an old iPhone languishing in my drawers - guess who's granddaughter has a working TV in her new Barbie house?  The girls were over the moon about that feature.The best birthday gift ever!",373,barbie
"I am a new barbie collector and obsessed with it and I really wanted a dream house but didn't know if to get the new hello barbie dream house or this one! And I have a answer for you! I really wanted the hello barbie dream house but This one just seemed more. Barbie like so I ended up getting this one instead! ( The Non Smart One) and I fell in love with it! Then shortly after my sister got my niece the hello barbie dream house and lets just say ,  my niece still go's completely insane for my dream house! For starters, The HBDH. Is way much smaller then this original one . This one has 3 floors, stands tall at 4Ft. Tall and 3FT. Wide. The HBDH is just a simple 2 story house, and it just looks way much smaller then the original dream house.I can't do too much comparison cause I haven't had a full experience with the hello barbie dream house but all I know is , I hear a Lot of ""ERROR CODE 51, I can not help you at this time"" lolAnd also I just love the classic barbie. I don't need all this technology and hello and wifi and automatic stairs lol this one is just fine! I absolutely love it!(Also disclaimer, the LED lights where installed by me. They where not included with the house! Just to add a little more , realistic feel to it!)",374,barbie
Very pleased!,375,barbie
Very cute~~!!!!!,376,barbie
Don't know how the grandkids will play with this but put it together and waiting until May 8th to give.  One of the corner pieces that connect the 2 floors together was broken in travel but husband able to glue it together and continue assembly.  Lots of assembly but cute once all together,377,barbie
It's great.,378,barbie
my daughter loves it and its almost taller than her,379,barbie
Easy to assemble.  Granddaughters love it,380,barbie
She loved it!!,381,barbie
very satisfied,382,barbie
"Lots of detail, but very flimsy. Kids love it, but not worth the price. It won't be a lasting toy.",383,barbie
Easy to put together. My kids love it.,384,barbie
Grand daughter loves it,385,barbie
"90% of the the women I know have said that at one point they wanted the Barbie Dreamhouse and so I made sure my daughter got it when she asked for it (she rarely asks for anything). She loved it. It was the only thing she asked for, for her Birthday. The only hiccup I've run into so far is the elevator comes off its track sometimes. When that happens I need to pop out two screws and run the cord that acts as the lift mechanism back into its respective gears. Outside of that she's never had a complaint and plays with it every day. It's one of those things yknow.My only other issue is I'd swear I selected the Plain Brown Box delivery option so she wasn't aware of what I was bringing into the house, and instead got the (albeit awesome) super flashy Barbie box. It was a bit crazy making her vanish for 5 minutes while I dragged it downstairs so she could be surprised.",386,barbie
"So much easier to put together than kid kraft and has stayed togetherI was worried my 4 yr yr old would distroy the garage or elevator. But, it's still intact! She loves it. It's very impressiveBest part is it only took me 15 minutes xmas eve to put togetherComes with lots of fun accessories",387,barbie
I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old niece and ordered it to be shipped to Japan just a few days before Christmas. I thought that she would receive it around New Years's day.  The gift arrived on Christmas Eve. My niece was so thrilled when she saw the Dreamhouse on Christmas Day!,388,barbie
Charitable gift.  I'm sure she's loving it.,389,barbie
My four year old loved it.  I think it's quite overpriced though.,390,barbie
"Your little princess will love this! You? Not so much..  I say that jokingly having had to put it together.  It comes in a thousand pieces, but the first two floors come together already. There is a very detailed step-by-step poster that you get in the Box. While the instructions are not written, they are pictured, and easy to follow if you go step by step.  I also looked on YouTube and watched a quick video of someone else putting it together which really helped me putting this together.  The directions seemed to make sense after I watched the YouTube video.  It did take me  two hours to put it together, and that includes putting all of the little toothbrushes, ovenware and table settings, and stickers on.  It has the sounds of a flushable toilet (too cute) , it has a fan that works, a sink with running water sounds and tooth brushing sounds, as well as an aquarium that turns.  However you cannot use all three at the same time as they all use the same interchangeable base.  Our granddaughter has spent countless hours playing with her Barbie Dream House.  She keeps her Barbie boat in the garage, and she enjoys having her Barbies go up and down the elevator.  So if there is any Saving Grace, the hours that you spent putting it together will be well worth it since there are many many many more hours of playtime.  I hope you found this review helpful",391,barbie
My four year old loved the house the moment it was set-up. We are satisfied with the product.,392,barbie
"Easy to put together. Garage door sticks a little, elevator  sticks a little, & the pool falls off the side.",393,barbie
Great dollhouse. Comes with all the accessories needed for hours of pretend play. Very sturdy.,394,barbie
"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. This is the only thing she asked for and as soon as she saw it we knew it was the right choice. The packaging came in the original box with a shipping label on it, which was fine since it delivered while our little girl was at school. It did need to be put together and is large so leave time for assembly if you want to surprise them with it together. 3 months later and she still plays with it every day. She even puts our mini yorkie in it to play. It is sturdy and we'll built and a perfect gift for any child who loves to play Barbie or dolls.",395,barbie
"This rating is on behalf of my niece who was determined that I purchase this Barbie Dreamhouse.  She absolutely loves it and plays with it everyday.  She also persuades me to play along with her some days.  All in all from the smile it puts on her fact, it was well worth the purchase.",396,barbie
Granddaughter absolutely loves this. Don't do get the batteries.,397,barbie
Bought it for my 11 yr old daughter and she loved it.  It was delivered on time and all the parts in tact.,398,barbie
Provides entertainment for hours for my 5 year old. Great toy!,399,barbie
the kid loves it which was the point. exactly as advertised but less expensive than at the store and shipped to your door. how can you beat that?,400,barbie
Missing the entire bathroom wall piece. Several accessory bags opened. I think this was used because a few accessories had the stickers already on.  Very disappointed since this was a birthday gift for my grand daughter.,401,barbie
Very good,402,barbie
"This was a Christmas present to my girls, a year later this thing has held up and they still play with it and it has survived abuse from destructive neighbors. Assembly requires a little patience and some real estate to lay everything out, but it is not difficult and completely plug and play.",403,barbie
My girls love it! I loved the price!,404,barbie
"Easy to put together. I would say it took an hour maybe a bit more to get it all together and stickered. Everything works great! Lots of small pieces with it for play like the forks and spoons, etc. I anticipate they will be lost before long. Our 4 year old loves it!",405,barbie
Nice my niece  loved it.,406,barbie
Exactly as described. Easy to assemble.,407,barbie
Pieces were broken on delivery. Elevator broken. Garage door broken. Awful purchase. C,408,barbie
"Was very disappointed with this. The dolls heads cannot go through the door ways. Doorways too low. The toilet, fan and fish tank all have to share the same base as the toilet. The elevator string was broke when we received item. It is broke again. The garage door breaks every time you open it not to mention you have to use a key to use it. The whole house platforms are way to narrow that you cannot play in the space. Wish I would of never bought it for my Granddaughter that was so excited when she saw the pictures of it and that is all she wanted for Christmas.",409,barbie
I purchased two of these.  The one we put together was a little girls dream and all the older ladies wanted one also.  Unfortunately it was given away by our granddaughter's mother and we no longer have it. The second one was returned due to privacy issues.,410,barbie
It came broken! Can't return it it was her big xmas gift. Had to fix it before assembling.,411,barbie
My 6 year old LOVES it.  It's huge!,412,barbie
Good,413,barbie
ProsKeeps my daughters entertainedLots of variety to the houseSound effects are awesome!ConsChallenging when putting together (for me),414,barbie
Bought as a gift and our 11 yr old is very pleased. Thank you,415,barbie
Great job zon!,416,barbie
My daughter was soooo excited to get this for her 5th Birthday!!!  Was not that difficult to assemble!!,417,barbie
Really love this Barbie Dreamhouse. Little disappointed that the elevator broke after a few days. Quality could be better.,418,barbie
"Very easy to put together, thankfully. My 4 yr old loves it.",419,barbie
Daughters love it. Took me about an hour to assemble. Directions are pretty clear. Surprisingly stable and secure. Lots of fun for the price. Came well packaged. Easy to open with decent packing for protection.,420,barbie
"Adorable house, elevator broke the same day we set it up, but cute otherwise",421,barbie
Arrived on time and as advertised. A gift for grand-daughter,422,barbie
"It came in a insecure large brown box that could have easily lose any parts. The card box should be more sturdy and it would have been nice if there was front cover because it was just plain cardboard. I didn't know what it was when it shipped to my home until I opened it and all those parts came out like a can of work. On the other hand, the dream house was put together without any hassle and I am thankful all the parts were there despite the cardbox was not completely closed. My daughter loves her Barbie house.",423,barbie
My granddaughter loved it she's 5 years old and I'm sure she'll play with it for another 5 years. I loved the fact that it was easy to assemble and that everything was in the box. Thank you so much,424,barbie
Grandkids love it.,425,barbie
"love it ...hours of playtime for my daughter, easy to assemble. Perfect for a 4-7 year old",426,barbie
Our 4 year old granddaughter was thrilled with the Barbie Dreamhouse even if it was taller than her! Too bad they don't make a smaller bendable Barbie doll that could sit on those small chairs and couch as the regular Barbie doll doesn't bend or fit them. There was nothing wrong with the item at the good/used price we paid & worth it for the entertainment it has given our granddaughter.,427,barbie
Had several broken pieces.,428,barbie
"You pay for the name, not the quality.  We have never purchased these big Barbie items for our girls because the quality is terrible.  Our youngest wanted this so bad for Christmas, so we caved.  Very flimsy and cheap plastic pieces.  Three parts were broken.  We glued them back together and our daughter is enjoying it.  Our other children wanted big items from American Girl.  Those pieces were worth every penny, nicely made, heavy duty products.",429,barbie
Super cute! My 5 year old loves it! So many little details! Love it!,430,barbie
perfect for our 5 year old grandaughter.,431,barbie
Hours of fun for my girls.  Great for ages 4 -10. elevator breaka off easily...But rest of it is awesome.,432,barbie
"Our daughter loves it, didn't take too long to set up it snaps together. Set aside time to sticker everything",433,barbie
NYCE,434,barbie
It came in a ton of pieces but was easy to put together. My daughter loves it and plays with it often. Well.worth the money.,435,barbie
easy to put together and grand daughters love,436,barbie
Perfect gift for my god daughter. She loves it. It comes with lots of stuff.,437,barbie
"Funny story. This thing magically showed up on my doorstep one day. I have no idea how it got ordered. My and wife and didn't order it. My daughter is 3 so I know she didn't order it. It was paid for using my card so it's wasn't free.  I have a few Amazon Echos around my house so I'm guessing it may have been ordered from a TV commercial playing for my TV or something. My daughter can barely get Alexa's attention on a good day so I highly doubt she ordered it. Anyways, it arrived in August and Amazon was nice enough to discount it for me since it was a little overpriced. We ended up just keeping it for my daughter and we held it until Christmas. I still don't know how this thing got ordered. It wasn't even in my shopping cart or wish list.As far as the Dreamhouse itself, my daughter loves it. People told me that putting it together would be daunting task but it wasn't that bad. It did get a little tedious towards the end though with all the small pieces like the chandelier and other trinkets. But overall I think it was worth keeping.The only 2 issues we've had was that my daughter had problems operating the garage door since it came off the track once or twice. The other issue is that it's very limited with the type of phone you can fit into the flat panel TV holder. They could have made it bigger since modern phones are way bigger than they used to be. That's a small issue but it could have easily been addressed.",438,barbie
So easy to put together! Me and a friend put together in about 30mins! My 8year old daughter loved it!,439,barbie
"Great dollhouse, and very easy to assemble.",440,barbie
My girls love it.,441,barbie
"It is gorgeous. Shipping was great came rite on time.  Only thing she can not keep it organized lol , but it wonderful plays with her cousin all the time , it a very large house , and instruction was  derailed  , all the pieces were intact , was  a wonderful Christmas present for my autistic daughter  that is on the spectrum but she is highly functuit teaches her a lot , I will recomd this product to every child and adult , as I as well spend time playing doll house with her.  I wounder was is for her or for me hmmm lol , thank you amazon.",442,barbie
This house is used daily by our 1 and 3 year old grand kids. Took a while to assemble but durable.,443,barbie
Great purchase,444,barbie
My granddaughter loves it.  They put it together themselves within thirty minutes.,445,barbie
"Very Cheap product.  Didn't last long at all.  The elevator lines become entangled so the elevator stopped working after a week.  We were never even able to attach the garage door, it didn't fit and wouldn't stay on.  Most side items are so small, they are a choking hazard for dogs and smaller kids.  This product should have been sold for $20; not worth the money.",446,barbie
"Great for a child with an active imagination! My daughter invites a diverse group of guests over, i.e. miniature marvel heroes, Disney figurines and small animals, so Barbie enjoys many guests. Easy to set up, but there are many pieces - so have patience.",447,barbie
Very happy with my purchase. It's adorable. Was worried it wouldn't get here in time for my granddaughter's birthday. But it has and I couldn't be happier. Received it very quickly.,448,barbie
It was in good shape,449,barbie
Our Granddaughter loved this Christmas gift!,450,barbie
My daughter loves this doll house.,451,barbie
"It's so nice and big.  It took me about an hour putting it together, instructions were on youtube.",452,barbie
good,453,barbie
They loved it,454,barbie
"My 4 year old daughter loves this dreamhouse. I love the removable sink, fish tank, grill, that make real sounds.",455,barbie
Fun. Lot of details. Great for the price. Great quality. I,456,barbie
Easy to put together and my daughter loves it. My only complaint is the elevator gets stuck constantly,457,barbie
"Barbie Dream house was the Christmas gift for my daughters 8 and 5 years old. They loved it very much, I saw there eyes shining while assembling it and they spend the whole day playing with it. Actually, I realized also that it was the dream house of my wife also!!",458,barbie
It was great daughter loved it great price compare to toys r us,459,barbie
My daughter just loves this house!,460,barbie
My daughter was so happy when Santa brought the dream house. The look in her face was worth the price.,461,barbie
I bought this for my 4-year-old niece who is absolutely picky about her the quality of toys. This is a perfect size and keeps her entertained!,462,barbie
loved it,463,barbie
Elevator on the side broke the first day... but my daughter loves it and just pretends it does...,464,barbie
For My Granddaughter. She loves it.,465,barbie
My Girls loved it!!!,466,barbie
Love it,467,barbie
I thought this would be like the one from last year hard to put together but thankfully it was the opposite. My 8 and 6 yr old was able to put it together,468,barbie
"Very nice, my daughters loved it.",469,barbie
"very good she was so happy, Santa came to her house!!",470,barbie
My granddaughter is four and she loves it! It was easy to put together. I did it while watching a movie.,471,barbie
Elevator broke a few times. Works better after some modifications. Was expecting better quality for the price.,472,barbie
I bought this for my granddaughter for her 3rd birthday.  We love it and enjoy playing together.,473,barbie
my daughter loves it it comes with sound effects love it.,474,barbie
"As a father, I actually enjoy making the elevator and garage go up and down. Don't ask but I find it enjoyable. My daughters always want me to play with them so I have to find some sort of enjoyment. Don't judge me!",475,barbie
"My daughters love this! They play with it every day, well made, easy to put together. Fun details.",476,barbie
My 5 year old loves it. Good quality.,477,barbie
MY GRANDDAUGHTER JUST LOVED IT.,478,barbie
"My daughter loves this and it was relatively easy to assemble (other than the garage door and the elevator... also the 2 things that keep getting stuck or coming apart). I'm perplexed by the vanity/dresser... if you choose to flip it around and take the sink off to add the fan/tank, then you have no sink in the bathroom. It would have made MUCH more sense to include 2 of them. I didn't even bother to show my daughter that they were interchangeable. She just puts the fan and the tank on the floor of different rooms... didn't want to lead to anger on her part for not having a sink in the bathroom if she used it as a dresser.",479,barbie
It was great thx,480,barbie
"Just what we expected, however nothing like the ones from the old days.This house has all necessary accessories the only down side is that has only one bedroom, it might need an expansion <U+0001F60A>.My daughter is playing with it every time she can, and my son joins her with a ken I bought for him.",481,barbie
"Daughters, 5 and 8 LOVED it. Sooo many cool little details and parts. Awesome Christmas surprise!",482,barbie
The picture just does not do it justice as to the height and detail of this house. It took me 2 hours to put together by myself. The only complaint I have is the stickers. I wish the MFG would just put ALL the stickers where they need to go ahead of time and not just few. All in all my six year old was very happy on Christmas morning.,483,barbie
"I was surprised at how easy this was to put together. There was a great YouTube video I found that made it very simple. My 4 year old daughter was thrilled was this and plays with it daily. It comes with a lot of accessories. My daughter particularly likes the animated accessories, like the fish tank and fan. Apparently you can put your smart phone where barbie's TV goes to make it like barbie is actually watching TV. My phone (iPhone 6 plus) is too big for this, but I think the regular sized iPhone would work.",484,barbie
"My granddaughter loved it, but the box was a little beat up!",485,barbie
Granddaughter loves it!,486,barbie
"Good toys , very nice",487,barbie
"The name says it all.  This was very easy to build.  It only took me about an hours, but my daughter loves it.",488,barbie
Easy to assemble and a beautiful house for Barbie!,489,barbie
The dreamhouse showed up in plenty of time. A couple of little pieces were broken but luckily they don't play an important role. Overall I'd say very good buy. I'm sure the granddaughters will enjoy it for years.,490,barbie
Excellent Barbie house. Was actually easier to put together then we thought it would be when we first saw all the parts. Took two adults about 15-20 minutes after all the parts were out. Kids will spend hours playing with this!,491,barbie
House came as expected. The side of the garage was broken and a few of the smaller pieces were missing. Probably wouldn't buy a big product with lots of pieces online again.,492,barbie
Love it for it to be a used product it is in really nice condition thanks a lot!!!,493,barbie
"The working garage door and elevator are fabulous.  This went together fairly easily and seems pretty sturdy.  Takes up quite a bit of room, but it is worth it as my grand daughter loves it.  Played with it all day on Christmas.  She loves all the accessories and the fact that she can move her ""princess"" barbies from one floor to the other.  Well worth the price.",494,barbie
"I was a little bummed with this Barbie house. One item controls 3 different sounds so you can only use the sink, the fan or the fish tank at one time. Also if you take the table out of the bathroom to use the fish tank or fan then the toilet no longer makes noise. The previous Barbie house had so many sounds and lights that this is a disappointment.",495,barbie
Made a Granddaughter's Christmas come true.,496,barbie
"Perfect, my granddaughter loves it..",497,barbie
Got This for both of my grands They absolutely love them,498,barbie
My daughters favorite toy.,499,barbie
Perfect. My nice could not be happier.,500,barbie

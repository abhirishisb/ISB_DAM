Review,DocID,title
More of the same. Good ideas and ideals like her other books but this felt a little repetitive.  I got something out of it but I was glad it was a quick read and that I didn't have to invest a lot.  The harder work comes in implementing.,1,ebook
I absolutely LOVE everything that Brene Brown writes!,2,ebook
Brene' Brown shares her personal stories in a way that I can use them in my own life. An amazing gift.,3,ebook
"I love the outdoors, particularly wilderness.  Braving the Wilderness is an inspirational book about finding our way from that place to which we often retreat, back to courage and connection. It<U+2019>s about learning to be with people without sacrificing our own values. It<U+2019>s about the wilderness within ourselves.Author and social scientist Bren<U+00E9> Brown, PhD, LMSW sees a serious disconnection in today<U+2019>s society. But much of the disconnection is within ourselves. It takes bravery to believe in and belong to ourselves, to resist fitting in because it<U+2019>s the popular thing to do. To be willing to stand alone is a wilderness.Our world is in crisis with gaping differences in politics and ideology. We need to find ways to connect, to share power among people, not over people. In order to effectively do this, we must learn how to be with people without letting go of who we are.Brown lists four practices that challenge how we think about ourselves and how we can connect with others:<U+2013> People are hard to hate close up: Move in.<U+2013> Speak truth to BS. Be civil.<U+2013> Hold hands. With strangers.<U+2013> Strong back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.As Brown elaborates on these four principles, it becomes clear that it is possible to stand alone and be who we are, yet celebrate being a part of the whole, of making a valuable contribution, of belonging.Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone is a serious book, yet still an enjoyable read. Bren<U+00E9> Brown draws on personal experiences, even painful ones, to demonstrate her beliefs, and she draws on her expertise as a research professor at the University of Houston studying courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy. I highly recommend this book for yourself, or for someone you love.",4,ebook
Loved this book.,5,ebook
"This is a good book where Brene raises some vital questions that will help us learn to listen to one another and speak with one another in a respectful manner. This is a timely reminder at the time of political and spiritual divisiveness. That said, I've found this book not as well organized and presented as her previous books and in my opinion has fewer examples compared to (for instance) Daring Greatly, which is by far my favorite.",6,ebook
I bought the book from EverythingMerchant. Pages 2 and 3 were missing and all of chapter one was out if order. Otherwise Brene Brown's book was so authentic. Highly recommend for someone who needs a little push into the right direction!,7,ebook
"I am not normally a self-help or personal improvement book fan. Books like Who Moved My Cheese? usually leave me with an intense urge to head for the hills. It<U+2019>s not that I don<U+2019>t believe in self improvement, I just don<U+2019>t think I can clich<U+00E9> my way to a better state of being or hug myself enough to make paying bills seem like a true joy.I had caught one of Brene Brown<U+2019>s TED Talks on shame and had liked it, showing it to both my college students and to women in a domestic violence program with whom I worked. I thought she had some valid points regarding vulnerability and openness, so, despite my misgivings about the premise of the genre overall, I read Brown<U+2019>s Braving the Wilderness.I was immediately struck by the thesis of her book, the idea that true belonging doesn<U+2019>t require us to be who others want us to be, but being who you really are regardless of where you are or who you are surrounded by. This is a thesis that she then breaks down into sections that are easy to follow and implement, showing how only by being willing to be vulnerable and open to others<U+2019> points of view will we truly grow in ourselves.Brown<U+2019>s points are equally backed by research, that both she and others have conducted, and her own anecdotal narratives. She does an excellent job throughout in presenting historical context and the results of scientific research without bogging down her points or interrupting the almost poetic flow of the writing. As someone in a PhD program, I was glad to see that she did not sacrifice the data and research in favor of flowery maxims, and managed to still make it interesting to those who may not care as much about the data-driven side of things.The narrative voice that Brown uses in this book is powerful. There are moments that will give you pause as you take a second to absorb what Brown has just told you. Her writing is honest, heartfelt and vulnerable, all of which makes her easy to relate to on a human level. The tone of the book does not come across as a guru on top of the mountain dispersing wisdom, but instead more as a friend who sees your struggles and wants to help you out.Probably the most significant impact of this book, however, is not so much its call for people to find their inner voices, but the appeal to us to remember the humanity in others. Throughout the book Brown pleads for a more civil society, one where we draw lines in the sand between holding to our own values and resisting the urge to dehumanize others. <U+201C>There is a line. It<U+2019>s etched from dignity,<U+201D> she writes, and then proceeds to chip away at the structures that keep us from reaching out to others in a meaningful way. While the book has great advice on building up to one<U+2019>s own potential, the biggest impact her book may have is in its ability to help people learn to bridge gaps with those they might not otherwise reach.One critique I do have for this work is that there were a few places where Brown felt like she might be reaching a bit, not in logical scope, but in word count. There were areas in the book that felt a little repetitive and where it felt like Brown was just trying to make a page out of a paragraph. However, these moments were few, and did not detract much from the overall messages that Brown was trying to get across.This book is a quick read, but one that will make you think. If you enjoyed books like Duckworth<U+2019>s Grit, Levitt and Dubner<U+2019>s Freakonomics, or van Dernoot Lipsky<U+2019>s Trauma Stewardship, then this book will be right up your alley. Braving the Wilderness is worth braving a trip to the bookstore.",8,ebook
Very deep and eye opening. Great reading,9,ebook
This book gave guidance too many topics that are pertinent to current topics.  It might help you be more civil in your next friendly debate.,10,ebook
LOVE Brene Brown!  Love how personal and real she is!  I really enjoyed this book!  Thanks Brene!!!,11,ebook
She's done it again. Brene' always seems to speak right to my soul. I'd read anything she writes. I only wish there was more!,12,ebook
"I think my favorite part of this book is when Brown talks about the way in which we can use conversation to bridge gaps between viewpoints. If we truly listen and engage in a intellectual discussion in our view, it may actually be possible to stop dehumanizing others and start the process of healing and loving.",13,ebook
Absolutely love Brene Brown! I will be listening to this a second time!,14,ebook
I loved listening to Brene Brown tell us about her journey.It was a real inspiration and made you think about many aspects of life and what is really important.So refreshing to hear someone push the importance of accepting other's point of view and not to correct a wrongdoing by counter-acting with another wrongdoing.HIghly recommend it as a positive read.,15,ebook
WoW! Very mind opening! Great book!,16,ebook
"I bought this book because I read three of Ms. Brown's other books. I enjoy her books and the way she writes about these complicated emotions that humans struggle with. I like the way she opens herself up and puts her own vulnerability and sometimes ugly emotions on the page. She is an example for us all on how to be painfully honest.Reading this book this past month happened at a time when I'm struggling to write my own memoir in which loneliness, aloneness and seeking the courage to be alone, while also dying to belong somewhere, all play a big role. This book provided me with a roadmap to write about my own experiences of being ""other."" My struggle has been to find my voice in a way that speaks to that struggle. Not in a ""woe is me"" kind of way, but in a sympathetic and also courageous way. In some ways, I often felt proud about standing outside of groups, while at the same time I felt more lonely and misunderstood than ever. It's this dichotomy that I think Ms. Brown captures so well in this book.Ms. Brown talks about four concepts/ideas that she calls the four elements of belonging: 1. People are hard to hate close up. Move in. 2. Speak truth to bullshit. Be civil. 3. Hold hands. With strangers. 4. Strong back. Soft front. Wild heart.The fourth element spoke to me the most. I am a life coach by profession and as a life coach, this is the way we want to stand in the world and it's the way we invite our clients to be, as well. When you can open your heart, but stand strong in your being, you make deeper connections with other people, while also showing people how to respect you. The wild heart she speaks of is the heart of duality: loving, yet tough; excited, yet scared; brave, yet afraid. I love that she speaks of a Wild Heart Club. I think many of us are members of that club and ought to be proud of that. We need to embrace our otherness and find others who do the same.In a world of separation, where there are polarized views on almost everything, and where people pick sides, the Wild Heart Club members are those people who decide to not pick sides. Who listen and process the information before acting. Who feel the pain, but don't lash out in anger. Who might even be angry, but channel that anger towards the good of all. Who feel joy and set aside guilt for being happy in a broken world.I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt alone and misunderstood. In other words, I think everyone should read this book.",17,ebook
Bren<U+00E9> gently forces us to consider the way in which we live our lives and invites us out into the wilderness. I would recommend this book to anyone searching within for the courage to be who they are and to matter most of all to themselves.,18,ebook
Incredible work of truth as usual from Bren<U+00E9> Brown!,19,ebook
"If you can't stand the first chapter, go ahead and stop. It only goes downhill from there.",20,ebook
Wonderful book an easy read I highly recommend this book,21,ebook
Book is insightful in some ways.  The profanity adds absolutely no value...wanted to recommend it to several others but again the profanity impunes some valuable insights.,22,ebook
Loved this book! Brene Brown has a way of writing what we need to hear in a clear and inviting way. She shows us how to be authentic in a way that guides rather than demands. She also shares why it's hard and how to overcome these challenges. Lets all try to be ourselves rather than give into our desire to fit in.,23,ebook
A great down to earth book about belonging!,24,ebook
"Brene Brown continues to explore humanity, people's choices and the psychology behind it all in this interesting and informative book.I enjoyed the practical, informative, unique and well researched perspective that Brene Brown brings to the topics discussed. Some of the topics weren't incredibly relevant to me, but still were very informative. Other topics really hit home for me and helped me to put a lot of pieces together in my own life. I really enjoyed the discussion of using language to dehumanize people. Very interesting and I would have liked to hear even more on the topic. While the beginning was a bit slow for me, it turned out to be another great book from the author.I definitely recommend Braving the Wilderness to those who have enjoyed her other books or anyone looking for some encouragement to be your authentic self even when others disagree.* I originally posted this review on Goodreads",25,ebook
"No one is as special as Brene.  Don't you just love everything she brings us?  This woman leads us into our inner journey, daring us to go where we feared to tread.  Her style is a simple, comical one - that brings simplicity to the complexity of the human condition.  I am so happy that she keeps speaking with us.  We need more of this in our lives...in action.",26,ebook
I am not very good at writing my thoughts but I wish to thank you for this amazing book.  You have brought out the many issues our generation have discussed.  Today's political times are so frustrating to us.  We hate the idea that we are afraid to talk to our own children but don't want to lose our connection nor go against our deep beliefs.  You have given me options to reintegrate into their lives and to see other ideas to pursue. I will try going slowly one small step and hope to stand in my own wilderness.,27,ebook
I always say that Brene Brown is my social work spirit animal. Her work inspires me to be a better person,28,ebook
I have the sense that the anecdotes and references in this book will date very quickly. But there are some beautiful metaphors.,29,ebook
"It's probably my fault for not reading the description. I follow Reese Witherspoon's book club recommendations and assumed this would be similar to Wild, it was not.I'm glad this was an audiobook purchase to listen to on long drives. I found some of her talk useful, however, the amount of political talk was a turn off. I doubt I would have finished reading it if I had purchased the book rather than audio.",30,ebook
Quality product and fast shipping!,31,ebook
"For what most would consider a self-help book, I found Braving the Wilderness to be gratifying in a way completely dissimilar to what one might find in the genre. This I attribute largely to its applicable ""rules"" but also to the authenticity with which the rules are explained.  I like Brene Brown's anecdotal style of writing, and speaking; she really allows the audience to feel at ease, and comfortable with sometimes ""disruptive"" or challenging subject matter.",32,ebook
I didn<U+2019>t realize how much the book was going to be on the political divide. And that<U+2019>s not what I was seeking.,33,ebook
I just finished this book and enjoyed many of the concepts and ideas it presented. It was an easy read and gave me some new insights into better communication styles and skills.,34,ebook
"Her insights, research and honest conversation is so valuable in a time when everyone is more distracted than ever before.I believe we are more connected than ever before and yet more disconnected from each other.She challenges the reader to bravely stand alone and understand what true belonging is. Her four principles of true belonging are simple but not easy. Love these themes:1. People are hard to hate close up. Move in.2. Speak truth as BS. Be civil.3. Hold hands. With Strangers.4. Strong back. Soft front. Wild Heart.Do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this book and pay attention to the conversations she will start with you, and conversations you will want to start with others.When we pay attention, attention pays. Well done Brene Brown, you are my girl crush.",35,ebook
"This book is so inspirational! Because I read this, I<U+2019>m going back to college. Seriously. CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND READ THIS.",36,ebook
"I could read and re read this author all day. When my eyes are too tired to read, I<U+2019>d watch/listen to her on TED! Reading Braving The Wilderness was like sitting in a cozy living room and soaking in Brene Brown discussing her research on and experiences with connectedness and the human need to belong. I<U+2019>ve never highlighted a Kindle book more and have already quoted areas for reflection at work and home. Braving The Wilderness is a true resource. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to both feel empowered and whole all by their lonesome-as well as inspired to get out there and make solid connections with others!",37,ebook
Brene is awesome and the book is good. I still liked the Power of Vulnerability (best book ever) significantly better.,38,ebook
Not as awesome as her book The Gifts of Imperfection.,39,ebook
"Parts of it are thought-provoking and interesting, but other parts are dry and dull.  I have had it for a while and don't find myself wanting to get back to it.  It strikes me as a re-packaging of earlier work.",40,ebook
This book was very thought provoking. My version is full of highlights and things I believe I will be mulling over for weeks to come. I love her acronym for braving and believe this book has something to teach each of us.,41,ebook
Great book!,42,ebook
Frank. Inspiring. Practical. down-to-earth reminders that we can do what we all face the similar challenges and that we can overcome them by changing the way we thinkl about them..,43,ebook
Love books!,44,ebook
"I'm going through the audiobook of Brene Brown's Braving the Wilderness, and I do think it might be the most important self-help book of our era. We've seen a lot in the news about isolation. We all feel as if we are bombarded by haters and toxic people. We are tweeting and reposting angry statements about the ""other"" political party, blaming, and victims. This book covers all of it in the most rational, heartfelt, way. THIS BOOK IS A WAY TO KEEP SANE.",45,ebook
Very thought provoking.,46,ebook
Interesting book.,47,ebook
Product is as expected.,48,ebook
"Very powerful messaging and learning in this book.  I will be adding this one to my <U+201C>top books<U+201D> list.  While I have followed Bren<U+00E9> as a speaker through some of her online appearances, this is the first book of hers I have read. GREAT storyteller and she speaks in terms that reach me.  I plan to read other books of hers soon.",49,ebook
Typical Brene Brown self-improvement stuff mixed with quasi-spiritual parables and observations. Not for the strong-minded.,50,ebook
"As all of Brene Brown's books do, it inspired, informed, and enlightened.",51,ebook
"This is my first Brene Brown book, but will not be the last.  I loved how it challenged me to rethink  some of my interactions and why.  I'm still thinking about what my wilderness is!",52,ebook
I love Brene Brown - she reads her books well and they are meaningful.,53,ebook
"This book was so well written. I<U+2019>ve never read anything by this author and now I want to go back and read everything. I<U+2019>ve never felt so connected to another persons words. Lovely, brave and beautifully done.",54,ebook
"It so resonated with me that I read through it twice right away. It affected my response to some types of communication immediately, gave me what I needed to understand the importance of one's own need to be clear and grounded, and how to 'respond to BS and stay civil.' (paraphrased). I also appreciated her perspective of how social media has separated us and allowed us to be unaccountable to each other, and that our real longing is for personal connection and contact ('move in, hold hands, with strangers'). This will be a foundation book for me for a long time.",55,ebook
Amazing audio!!,56,ebook
Great read! I loved it!,57,ebook
"I recommend to anyone thinking about diving into this book....just try the first chapter. If you<U+2019>re not sucked into it by then, I<U+2019>ll give you your money back myself.",58,ebook
This book should be required reading for every person in America. Solid. Practical. Vulnerable. You will close the book feeling equipped to live bravely.,59,ebook
"After each book from Brene Brown I would tell people her newest installment was my favorite. Now, once again this is my new favorite from her. It is different from her other books and even feels like it's a standalone, whereas her previous works became a trilogy of sorts.She's so brave and real as usual and creates a safe place for the reader to become more of who they are meant to be.I love this book and enjoyed every inch of it!",60,ebook
Meh,61,ebook
"Inspirational and insightful, Brene Brown offers hope in a spiritually ill climate.",62,ebook
"Brene Brown is really on to a way of life that is inspiring.  Would love to listen again and again, however, the serious tone of her voice i just cannot go another round.  She does admit she is a serious person, aren't we all somewhere along path  of life, but really - please lighten up, cut a joke or something - i know they are there in your life & we want to hear them - laugh in the face of fear!  i want to be there with her, but this is too heavy throughout the book as i struggled to listen to the end.  i personally need to break away from the ""serious mentallity"" and need to lighten up any way i can on the journey.  Thank you for sharing Brene - maybe a revisit in a few months - would like to listen to more of your books, but too much heavy for me right now.",63,ebook
Love this book. She's done it again. I think this is one of Brene's best.,64,ebook
"In this time in our history, belonging can be a challenge.  Brene' walks you through to understanding true belonging and how to live in the wilderness.",65,ebook
Great book as it speaks truth,66,ebook
"absolute must-read for everyone. it's about humanity, the journey of the self, how to hear people, how to listen, how to connect.",67,ebook
Brene Brown is accessible. She takes some complicated theory and uses everyday stories to explain. I can read her books in two days rather than two months.Brene Brown is authentic. My heart responds to what she says - not just my head. I almost always cry at least once when reading her books because I recognize my own pain in the pain she describes.I have gratitude for Brene Brown.,68,ebook
"Great reminder  for myself to stand tall, know who you are, and take chances! Life is a journey good or bad.... Continue to move forward.",69,ebook
Another great book by Brene!  She definitely tackles some real life problems and was very current with her discussions in this book!,70,ebook
"I thought this book would be something else. I find myself in a particularly lonely place in my life, and thought this book would address ME personally. Instead, it's about not judging others and getting politically polarized. It's not that I don't think those are important issues, because goodness knows they ARE, but that's just not what I thought I was going to be reading about.To be fair, I only read half of the book, but after glancing through the remaining three chapters (Speak The Truth To Bullshit, Hold Hands With Strangers, and Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.) it looked like more of the same.I would say if you're feeling frustrated in today's political climate, are tired of everyone living in the bubble, and you've sworn off Facebook because of the shrill, fearful, preaching tone--and you want to somehow ""heal"" the world--this is the book for you. If you're going through something more personal, this isn't going to help you much, even though the book synopsis and the reviews suggest otherwise.",71,ebook
"I loved her authenticity, it screamed truth, learned so much about myself and life. I cried about 50% of the time.. that<U+2019>s how deep it took me. I loved it and recommend it to anyone who wants to live more fully and authentically",72,ebook
"Wow! Wow! Wow! Thank you for your courage Brene Brown. This is not an easy read, but if you allow it to, this book could open your heart to people you may have previously considered to be your enemy. This is a must read!",73,ebook
"Braving the Wilderness is Brene Brown<U+2019>s poignant, insightful elegy to the pain of isolation and loneliness that is part of the childhood memory of so many adults<U+2014>the pain of being misfit everywhere<U+2014>even within our own families. It<U+2019>s a pain that not only lives with us as the years go by, but forms us and informs our relationships with others.  Brown gives us permission to give ourselves permission to be ourselves, even if we belong only to that group of one. She slices through the idle and often hypocritical noise about authenticity in a world that is faux-almost-everything, over-hypes what is <U+2018>trending<U+2019> and bathes us in conformity through style, fashion, political correctness and other forms of social herding. This book is an elixir of courage to stand in our values and value others as they stand in theirs and to form strong bonds of human connectedness not only with those who are like us, but also with those who are decidedly not. She advances often lost or derided values of civility, confidentiality, nonjudgment, accountability and more. Drink deeply from this well of wisdom to distinguish between belonging and fitting in; return frequently to sip again so that you can supplant the latter with the former in your life.",74,ebook
Not a fan.,75,ebook
"This book needs to be listened to, read, followed, and practiced. Relevant... so, so relevant. I've been sharing it with everyone and anyone who will listen.",76,ebook
"Some good nuggets. A lot of it was kinda vague and hard to put into practice. Her writing flows, but isn<U+2019>t structured as much as I prefer. Not bad, but maybe not life-changing.",77,ebook
This book is excellent and very helpful in my journey,78,ebook
"Love the vulnerability of Brene in sharing her stories and making the writing relatable. Uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure... Vulnerability",79,ebook

"Brene puts words, vision, and vibrancy to this hard and challenging path I've been on for quite awhile. It's like the effect of waking up on a trip and realizing where you are, how you got there, and where you are going...and want to be going. I'm very glad I read it!",84,ebook
"I have had amazon prime for at least a decade and this is the the first review I have ever written. Go read this book and and keep doing it every day until the words are engraved on your wild, wild heart.",85,ebook
"I noticed I was flipping through the pages pretty fast. I did not finish the book. I read Brene Brown because some of my clients do.  I have bought them all in hard cover, loan them out, and refer to them often. The books are written in a way that is familial, respectful to the reader, and colloquial.I ordered a hard copy from Amazon. I bought one for my daughter, too.I guess I didn't give it a higher rating because it comes across like a well intended self  help book by your favorite aunt. I show her TED talks to clients and have the highest respect for Dr. Brown. It takes a lot of talent to write this level of book for people who may be having a hard time in  life. She has exceeded that expectation.",86,ebook
Wonderful book. Very inspiring and thought provoking.,87,ebook
This book is life changing for me. I<U+2019>ve recommended it numerous times. Love it.,88,ebook

"This is a must-read for anyone searching for ways to <U+201C>turn their mind<U+201D> from fear & isolation to brave & courageous acts. This book provides  profound stories and examples of how people living in fear and existing to <U+201C>fit in<U+201D> everywhere they go, regardless if these attempts are made in violation to their own values and are able to develop the bravery and courage to transform themselves and find their path to authentic living through their OWN values.  I have  found all the books I<U+2019>ve read authored by  Bren<U+00E9> Brown to be life-changing in all the best ways, this book is no exception!",91,ebook
"I'm half way through reading this book....at this point totally disappointed and hating it. I love her Ted Talks and other books. I feel like she is just writing to write now and offering nothing new. Hoping it gets better! Still a fan of Brene, but not this book!",92,ebook
One of her best yet!,93,ebook
"I loved this book as much as I love all of Brene Brown's work. I especially like this one because of the focus on community and belonging.

Bren<U+00E9> Brown is inspiring! I honestly felt as if she were speaking to me directly, she hit so many points that have been a part of my life for years, and gave great examples for getting through those times.",97,ebook
Includes inspiring stories about standing alone and the courage it takes to be vulnerable enough to brave the wilderness.  Great confidence builder and reminder that we are all connected.,98,ebook
"Brown balances theoretical understanding with lived experience and stories that frame her core principles. This book didn<U+2019>t change my life, but it did shift my vision toward a more virtuous me.",99,ebook

I am a self proclaimed non-reader. I have listened to Brene<U+2019> Brown on podcasts and decided this is a book I needed to read. And I am so glad I did. This is a book everyone should read. I have to say I have had it pretty easy in my life. But I have suffered loss and bullying and shame to some extent. And now that I am 50 ish I am finding myself in in the <U+201C>wilderness <U+201C> in many ways. This book has helped me to find my way. This is a book that I will read over and over.

"Gift for Friend, she really likes this book.",114,ebook
This book is remarkable because it is based on social research in the field.A key chapter is speaking truth to BS.I finally have words to describe and deal with non-sense.,115,ebook
"Where to begin?  I have been a follower of Brene Brown for many years- reading her books, listening to her on podcasts, and watching her on TV and the TED stage. He research on empathy and vulnerability has been life changing for me, and as a communication studies professor, it has also graced the hearts of thousands of my students over the years. With this deep respect for her research and heart-warming storytelling, I anxiously awaited the release of her new book Braving the Wilderness.This book had me in tears throughout the whole thing.  Brene has a way of hitting the nail on the head when it comes to relating to people and their struggles.  When she tells the story of not making the drill team, for example, most of us can relate to that on some level; I know that I could.  And when she talks about having courage to stand up and speak your truth, it felt like she was talking directly to me.Braving the Wilderness is a beautiful, timely book that not only makes the reader think, but captures their heart as well.",116,ebook
"Another excellent book by Bren<U+00E9> Brown. Her books always make me think and act; her work inspires me to live a more wholehearted life. Start with Daring Greatly, that book caused me to take major action to better my life.",117,ebook
Great book with very useful information on how to deal with interpersonal relationships and how to be true to yourself.,118,ebook
Very helpful for navigating today<U+2019>s political heat at work and at play. I recommend to everyone that cares how our country moves forward.,119,ebook
"It is a book that is decent at best. The other books are great in its specificity on the materials, research, findings, and theme. With this book I felt that it was all over the place. I have read all of her books and they all seemed to connect within one another and each other. This one somehow I felt that it was more of a fitting book than a connecting one. It was fitting that it had some good content material that I found useful and got some insight on. However, I was unable to connect them with the other books and on how specifically to put it together with the other concepts that she mentioned in the previous books. I felt as if the material needed a little more time to find more measurable target goals and its results for its application. I think there is promise in the concept mentioned on ""True Belonging"", just more research and targeted goals need to be implemented. I was left with more questions and confusion in the end. I did enjoy the paradox with Carl Jung, and will be implementing those concepts within my path to ""True Belonging""",120,ebook
"Great book. Lots of great information. For sure thought-provoking, definitely. Highly recommend. Love this author. The information is so well written and paced with humor and practicality.",121,ebook
"I got this out of the library, thank goodness.  Like so many other commenters here, I like Brene Brown's style, insight---usually. This book needs to be edited to about 50 pages.  First couple of chapters are ok, but after that it feels like she's filling up the pages to get it to the printer as fast as possible.  So Brown repeats herself (the BRAVING acronym is filled out at least 2x--- which I didn't find useful the first time) and tells too many stories, or lets us know how things shake down in her family, etc. etc.  I had to wait weeks on the library list for my name to finally come up.  But, it's better than spending $ on this book.  Sorry Brene.  Next time, please take your readers more seriously-- most of us are not willing to settle for the elementary-school style of content, organization, and tone you present in ""Braving the Wilderness"".  PS:  I did appreciate her talking about the danger of the them/us that's going on constantly since Trump became president-- how unhelpful, unproductive, etc it is.  That Brown supports hunting, however, was a surprise--- I come from a big hunting family...and killing gives me the creeps.",122,ebook
"One of the most profoundly life-changing books I have read in a very long time.  I cannot explain how much this book affected me.  Reading certain parts was like flipping a switch in my thought processes.  While I had heard of Brene Brown's work, I had not really delved into it until reading this book.  I highly recommend it to anyone seeking to find peace with inner turmoil, find a way out of getting sucked into negative energy, and learning to cope with the things that cause stress, and also to learn to stand in your own truth and live in integrity.  My words pale in comparison<U+200B> to what lies within this amazing book.  I have shared some of the lessons with my family and we have had some great discussions because of it.  Love, love, love.  Thank you, Dr. Brown.  Your book changed my life personally and professionally, and it really needed a change.",123,ebook
This book was so incredibly insightful and thought provoking! I also loved the writing style (very relatable). Highly recommend for sure.,124,ebook
This book gives the best depiction of what it feels like to be an outsider and why we shouldn't view it as being strange but actually liberating.,125,ebook
"I have never felt like I belong, and I have always struggled with betraying myself in order to fit in.  Berne<U+2019>s words are a powerful wake up that instead of searching for belonging outside of myself alone, I should also find it within.  I see myself reaching back to this book over and over as I work to create true belonging in my life and that of my children.",126,ebook
I love what Brene Brown has to say about belonging and vulnerability. I think this book is a must read for anyone who struggles with how to care and connect in a divided culture.,127,ebook
"Brene has written yet another wonderful book. I found this one not to be as earth shattering as her other books, but it still gives plenty to think about in terms of vulnerability and how to make the world your own.",128,ebook
"This was the first Brene Brown book I have read and could relate to be your best when you stand alone and strong being true to yourself.  I have written about your relationship with the world is to have a relationship with yourself first, so the subject is very much aligned to what I believe, although Brene is very much more eloquent than I. I loved Brene sharing of her personal stories and her humility and self-depreciating humour in this book.  I enjoyed it so much I went on to read Rising Strong.",129,ebook
"This is a book to come back to again and again, especially in transitional times of life. Our nations and families ARE disconnected, and we don't show our true selves.  But the wilderness is dangerous and we have to be brave. Brown has studied  courage, vulnerability, shame, and empathy for sixteen years. Watch her top Ted Talk on vulnerability and read this and her other books. Her four basic rules can be life-transforming.",130,ebook
This book was amazing. I got it for Christmas gift for my family and regularly reference it.,131,ebook
"If you are struggling with how you feel in our current political, and economical climate; if you feel you fall somewhere in between it all- YOU ARE NOT ALONE!! Bren<U+00E9> helps us, once again, navigate through our struggles and emerge being true to ourselves. The wilderness may seem scary, but it's where we can stand up for who we are and what we believe! Might be my favorite Bren<U+00E9> book yet! #WildHeartsClub",132,ebook
I love all Brene Brown books and this one is timely! Thanks Brene for being an amazing Social Worker and researcher!,133,ebook
I was challenged reading this book to examine my lack of vulnerability and how I react in the heated political climate we have in the US.  Dr. Brown is very centric in her discussion - she has a nice balance of redneck training and academics in her life story so she should have credibility to a broad audience (and being a native of the south and only understanding coming to a real understanding of why the rebel flag was offensive to some in the last 10 years I have some redneck cred as well - no offense intended).  I hope many will read this book and be challenged to be civil in all discussions and find real connection with their human family.,134,ebook
One of the few books I can<U+2019>t finish.,135,ebook
I haven<U+2019>t read any of the author<U+2019>s books but now want to read her other ones. Insightful on how much I can relate to some of the scenarios.,136,ebook
"There are a number of interesting thoughts-  I may need to re read this, as the flow of the book wandered a bit.  The core premise seems clear, however the narrative is a bit disjoint.",137,ebook
Another excellent work by Brene Brown!  So much helpful information. Her candidness is refreshing!,138,ebook
The suggestion to read this book came at a moment in time when I needed it most. My journey into the wild is just beginning and I'm ready!,139,ebook
"Like all of Br<U+00E9>ne<U+2019>s work, it<U+2019>s very important, deep and not always comfortable. She is so talented at outlining the current emotional struggles of all of us. My favorite part of the book was about dehumanizing and her sharp list of examples. Potent thought catalyst!!",140,ebook
It always seems that I read Brene Brown books at the right time in life. Wilderness is wilderness but Brene Brown makes facing it seem less scary. Let the BRAVING begin!,141,ebook
ugh. psychobabble. There's a lame irony in Brown's exploitation of her reader's vulnerability.  Maya grant me the courage to submit a review,142,ebook
"It feels like an exceptionally honest book, and the message is valuable.",143,ebook
Good in the beginning and the it just becomes a bunch of random personal stories. She discusses research but not in a very thorough way.,144,ebook
"This book should be required reading for life. It has amazing insights and challenges that will change your way of thinking and being, and hopefully uplift the lives of those around you.",145,ebook
Brene Brown has brought a lot of great perspective to all of her books. Rising strong was life changing for me and her other books are just as great.,146,ebook
If you only read one book in 2018; read this.,147,ebook
"at first her tone is a little abrasive... getting into it, her message is great. #worthit.",148,ebook
Every time we talk about it and the I it so I can see be the best first time since in my life,149,ebook
This is a great book with great messages at a time when both are greatly needed. The world needs us to be true to ourselves and do what is right.,150,ebook

"Highly recommended! Great read after ""Gifts of Imperfection"", ""Daring Bravely"" and ""Rising Strong""! Read when ready...I take some time to process between these :)",153,ebook
Amazing author with deep research.,154,ebook
This book has many gems of wisdom. It is compact. In that I mean there is not a lot of extraneous rambling which I find refreshing. I won<U+2019>t say I learned a lot or discovered new ideas but I certainly was reminded of some important learnings which were voiced in contemporary yet poetic terms.,155,ebook
"In Braving the Wilderness, The author explores the topic of belonging and how to discover true belonging with yourself, as well as how to brave the wilderness and stay true to your journey and message instead of trying to fit in. Reading this book has been timely for me as I've gone on my own metaphorical journey into the wilderness with my business and life. I particularly found the idea that I belong to myself and that I can give permission slips to myself to be helpful, because its allowed me to look at my life and give myself the necessary breathing space I needed as I made some tough transitions. I highly recommend this book as a guide to help you brave your own wilderness and find true belonging.<U+00A0>",156,ebook
Thanks,157,ebook
"Be Yourself, it sounds cheesy, like something you hear in public school that is so abstract as to be worthless. It is not a phrase that is used much in the book if it all but it sums up the book well. Brene Brown surprises me in the amount of depth she can dig up on what it means to be yourself. One of the paradoxes she sets forth is that to achieve belonging you have to belong to yourself first and foremost. What does it mean to belong to yourself? It means sticking to your guns on knowing who you are and who you are not. It means knowing what you find important and true and what you find unworthy of your time and false.She talks about how we often trade belonging for fitting in. When we do this we don't have true connection because fitting in depends on changing who we are so others will like us. So while we often fear that if we voice disagreement with others and have an unpopular opinion we will face rejection this is not true. It is true not everyone will like you but it is not true that you can't find acceptance without changing who you are. We may find that once we know who we are and decide to stick to our values that we will find ourselves ""braving the wilderness"" that includes uncertainty and criticism. This book gave voice to the wilderness experience I have been having for the past few years. I love that she does such deep study yet makes the material understandable and engaging for the everyday person that is not a social scientist. I would recommend this to anyone high school age or older, maybe even late middle school age. Everyone could gain something from this book as it addresses things every human being deals with.",158,ebook
LOVE this book!,159,ebook
Please take the time to read this book. It is a wonderfully written book which focuses on how to be comfortable with yourself. I loved this  book and have purchased other books from Bren<U+00E9> Brown.,160,ebook
"My favorite of Brene's books so far, incorporating and expanding on much of her previous material.",161,ebook
"I am very thankful to be able to read this book, and it means so much to overcoming my weakness and embracing myself for I am.",162,ebook
"Simply put, you will see your life in a whole new way after you listen to this.",163,ebook
"I<U+2019>ve read Daring Greatly by Brown and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was very excited for Braving the Wilderness. I was quite disappointed. It entire books can be summed up in the statement: Don<U+2019>t argue political extremes. Add in 100+ pages of fluff and a Maya Angelou quote that is repeated 50 times. I finished the entire book, because I truly believe in reading the entire piece before making any judgments, but I will be honest - this was a hard one to finish.",164,ebook
I enjoyed all the examples Bren<U+00E9> used. They made me uncomfortable because they feel real. I can't wait to read more of her work. I also enjoyed her TED Talk on vulnerability. Great stuff!,165,ebook
"Anything that comes out of Brene' Brown's mind is worth hearing.  Be it writings, lectures, Ted Talks, you name it.  Brene' Brown ""Gets It"" without question.  As a human-being who long suffered under the burden of shame, and as mental health counselor, I have benefitted greatly from, and have become a committed advocate of her work. Brava to Brene' Brown.",166,ebook

Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True...,174,ebook
Great book!  I ordered this one for a friend!,175,ebook
An affirmation that life can be challenging and rewarding. A reminder to be true to yourself while taking the time to seek understanding of those with home you may not agree. A call to seek community and joy. An inspiration to live bravely in this life that may at times seem as daunting as a walk in the wild.,176,ebook
"This is a book to make you think, but written for anyone to understand.  Full information to make you go forward with confidence and hope.",177,ebook
Great book,178,ebook
This book certainly makes a person think how they live their life.  The research of Brene<U+2019> Brown is intriguing.,179,ebook
Brutally honest discussion about much of the pain existing in our world.,180,ebook
This was good but not the best of her books.,181,ebook
"If you<U+2019>re a white suburban mom just getting into self help, this is perfect. With someone dealing with MDD, ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD this book gave me like 2 skills I can use while the remaining pages talked about the author<U+2019>s privledged life experiences in an attempt to relate to the reader. While I appreciate the attempt, I would also like a more comparable experience to feeling out of place than when she met Oprah, maybe try a more relatable touch that isn<U+2019>t something most of us can<U+2019>t experience. Overall, I felt that this book was inaccurate in representing the Average Person with a Mental Illness and their struggles with how someone with four other businesses would spend writing a book. Effort was nice, but most self help books written by successful white women do marginally better than others. Not well written, scattered stories and thoughts to try and fit the subject, and experiences that made me feel unaccomplished in my struggles. I<U+2019>m looking for actual in addition to my therapy and medication in self help nonfiction, not how you overcame feeling alone meeting your favorite, and incredibly famous, poet that only a small percentage get to experience. 1/5",182,ebook
"<U+201C>True belonging doesn<U+2019>t require us to change who we are; it requires us to be who we are.<U+201D> The synopsis written on the back of the book is all you need to know, don<U+2019>t bother reading the entire thing. This is the first (and last) Brene Brown book I<U+2019>ve read, and I found it extremely shallow. Amazon classifies it as a spirituality book, which is a far stretch. More of a self help book with no enlightening features. Not sure what all the hype is about.",183,ebook
Brene's work touches my heart! Thank you for sharing your gifts with the world!,184,ebook
I love this book. I listen on audio during my work commute. Brene' never ceases to amaze me with her wisdom from hard worked research. I've listen to the book several times already because I always glean something new from her insight. My perspective on life is very different after reading her work. Highly recommend taking advantage of what she has to teach!!,185,ebook
When your daughter tells you to buy her 'anything by Brene Brown' you know it must be good.,186,ebook
Thank you!,187,ebook
Great audio,188,ebook
I struggled with another book by Brene' Brown but have really enjoyed this book thus far.  I am listening to audiobook and find her voice and tone very listenable.,189,ebook
"If not familiar with Brene Brown, this book can be life changing. She shares perspectives and practices that help connect you to others while enlarging your soul.If you are familiar with Ms Brown<U+2019>s works, this book has similar content to previous books but with a more evolved perspective. I think definitely worth reading.",190,ebook
We are studying this book in my Small Group and I'm just not connecting with it.  Too many buzzwords and psycho babble for my taste.  I'm not sure if I'm too arrogant or too stupid to get anything from this.  Not my favorite.,191,ebook
"As a 60 year old woman of strong mind and body but still struggling with ""getting out there"" and trying not to feel invisible in a room full of people, I found this book to be useless.  I have watched some of Ms. Brown's TED talks and found them inspirational, so I bought this book.  It seems to be all about her, her views, her heroes...etc.  And really, I get that she struggled as a child (most people did) and found success, but most of us will not find our calling and become a celebrated friend of Oprah.  Many of us have had that one great friend or spouse and have lost them, leaving us in the wilderness.  Many don't and never will have a loving, supportive significant other and great kids.  Even finding a true good friend is so hard these days.  So how to be alone?  How to brave the wilderness?  I don't think so.  No help, comfort or good advice here, just her broad view on how to deal with a world getting harder and harder to live in happily.",192,ebook
Another wonderful book to inspire in the quest for wholeness and truth,193,ebook
"Fantastic read. Useful, real world tips on standing alone.",194,ebook
purchased this after reading the glowing reviews only to find i disagree! The author sounds like she is whining the entire backstory. I was looking for a book that helps me fit in; but my experiences did not line up with what the author was saying. very disappointed with this book,195,ebook
One of the best books ever written on shame and authenticity!  Changed my life in a couple of ways!,196,ebook
"Wonderfully motivating, Brene<U+2019>s latest book reassured me at a time in my life when I feel that there is little room for being different and an aging member of society whose contributions are a thing of the past!",197,ebook
Brown continues to teach wisdom to any participant of the 21st century.  The book lays out true homework for those who wish to kick their life into high gear and leave the banality of living in the rut.  Just hope she can top this one with more inspiration and more human insight with what ever she is presently working on for her next release.,198,ebook
This book is much needed these days of social media addicting.  Belonging means real face to face interactions. Be courageous and be yourself!,199,ebook
Requested gift,200,ebook
"I loved this book. It was so timely for me, and helped me put so many things I already knew in my heart into words. I<U+2019>ve read Ms. Browns books before and liked them, but this is by far the best.",201,ebook
"What Brene explores in this book is refreshing, liberating, and daunting. I love how she advocates for us to have the courage to stand in that place where we are true to ourselves.  I concur with the need to embrace and live from our wild hearts.I am so thankful for this book.",202,ebook
"Nobody understands vulnerability like Bren<U+00E9> Brown. I loved this book, have listened to it four times and I still find nuggets of wisdom. And I love Bren<U+00E9>'s down to earth, tell it like it is, colourful Self. Very refreshing indeed! A must read!",203,ebook
"Absolutely incredible. Brene Brown once again shows a knack for finding the universal and fundamental aspects of human existence that we, as a society, try to ignore. By baring her own fears, struggles, and insecurities, in this book, Brene Brown gently coaxes us out of the fortresses that we have built around our hearts, showing us that the walls we have built to protect ourselves from pain also prevent us from experiencing joy and connection. Anger and contempt and isolation and clinging to what is familiar does not truly assuage our deep sense of loneliness.I have no doubt that if everyone were to read this book, the world would become a better place.",204,ebook
"Amazing insights, funny and deep.  Read it all in one sitting.",205,ebook
"If you want to know you are not alone in this journey of life, this is a book for you. Dr. Brown is her usual eloquent self yet at the same time her voice is the most vulnerable of all of her books. This book should be required readin for every human being!",206,ebook
"Wonderfully written.  Not a typical romance, but instead a journey.",207,ebook
"A lot of fluff , the core message could be read in just 25% of all those pages. Her prime is in other previous work",208,ebook
"I loved the Gifts of Imperfection, and I even heard Brene speak about Braving the Wilderness the night I got it. The speech was great and made waaaay more sense than the book. I am halfway through and have no motivation to finish it. It<U+2019>s terrible. It just gets worse and worse because there<U+2019>s no point, no depth, no big idea. You could fit the general idea of this book on a couple of Post-It notes. Read all the other one-star reviews for an accurate overview. Don<U+2019>t waste your time with this book.",209,ebook
Amazing! Bren<U+00E9><U+2019>s books are always life-changing! I will meet her in person one day because I will focus on it with my piece of universal energy <U+0001F49C>,210,ebook
Another great book from Brene Brown. Very applicable to our political and social climate today and great reminders for how to live our best lives,211,ebook
"Great book for anyone trying to carve their own path in these difficult times. If you<U+2019>re feeling a disconnect w/friends, loved ones or even strangers this is the book for you.",212,ebook
"I'm a fan of Brown's work (and TED talk), but this was just okay. I don't think she had enough pulled together/thought through for a full release, so it feels not as complete. As if rushed for a deadline.I like the ideas of being brave with one's conviction, and willing to put yourself out there, even if you're alone to stand up for what you believe, but this still felt very *white* and from a protected, ""majority"" space.Two pieces that frustrated me.A) At one point, Brown tells the story of a pastor that speaks up for LGBTQ rights. This story is to help illustrate how one, even in the face of the (potentially homophobic Christian) community they serve, they are will to stand up in support of others. This was described as Bravery, which it is for those who are in a community that encourages you to stay quiet in your majority comfort.What would have *also* been nice is to pair stories of people coming from majority/dominant culture along with those who have had to break out into the wilderness much much earlier, out of necessity, because they are NOT the majority. Because they are queer, or disabled, are not white, etc. The narrative around bravery is ""different"" when it feels less like a choice, but it's no less Brave. The focusing on the straight pastor supporting LGBTQ rights, but not including a story of an actual LGBTQ person alongside it felt more...performative for the sake of the narrative. (Not that the pastor is performative. Just how her story is being used here.)At one point, those Braving the Wilderness are likened to being at an outdoor dance party, like, ""I want to go to There""- the place where people are free, dancing and Brave, but without also giving time to those that are out there dancing because For Real, they have Zero choice, and had not been given the option to go Inside. So, some are out in the Wilderness making the best of what that means, and yes, sometimes that means dancing. Some might be out in the wilderness and are sad, or lonely, or are just doing their laundry, but they're still in the Wilderness, because they are living their Non-Majority lives. It felt like for Majority people, like say, straight people, white people, abled people, they can Choose the Wilderness, and then have the cool option of touristing to the Wilderness Dance Party, but then still not really fathom the chasm that exists between those that can Choose to be there, or even Choose to go back Inside, like when it gets cold or really really hard, and those that still have to be outside no matter what.B) The second point that really frustrated me was the call for civility in these discussions as we Brave the Wilderness. This part felt really really White Lady Liberal Feminism. Like, ""If only you told me that criticism about my behavior in a nicer tone, or if you did it in a compliment sandwich, I would more likely listen to you tell me about that racist thing I just did.""I think calling for people to be civil is fine. Let's be nice to each other, sure. BUT, it's problematic if it's being pushed and also it's not discussed how calls for civility are often weaponized by white people, especially White Women, as a way to control the conversation (and STILL end up oppressing others.) I feel like white people especially, and I'm a white woman, need to walk into those ""Let's be civil"" conversations with a full understanding of how we can abuse those specific calls to action for our own favor- to protect us, make us less uncomfortable, and put the burden on others to have to adjust to what we think is Real Civil Discourse. I found Brown's call for civility without cautioning about how that argument often abuses people of color to be troubling.So, for me, as a queer disabled person, I found this book is probably ""nicer"" and more inspiring if you're coming from the Majority space. Where it can feel novel/scary to stand up for someone who is different than you.If you're coming from a not-majority space though, it may not feel as connected as you may wish it to be.My last point that frustrated me is that I wish Brown showed more data. Often she writes, ""The data showed us that people feel like X,"" but never lists more concrete data. it's very general about big points, and it normally made me wish for something slightly heavier on the science part of social science.I listened to the audio version, and thought Brown did a fine job on the narration. I like her voice, so it was nice to listen to.",213,ebook
This author should take her own advice as far as being willing to listen to other perspectives. When she is challenged on social media (with regards to political perspectives or other views) she often shuts people out entirely.  The author brags about killing doves (a bird that literally symbolizes peace) yet asks others to extend compassion to others.The book was all over the place and the reader is constantly reminded of the author's credentials and previous writing accomplishments. I enjoyed Daring Greatly immensely but this book was phoned in. It seems she had a deadline to meet and threw something together.,214,ebook
"Listening to this on Audible.I suggest you read this book to gain an understanding of how to fix our (United States) relational, communication & ""you're either with me or against me"" problems.What I really appreciate about the content is that it is based on objective team research with YEARS of data to support the conclusions presented. When more personal subjective perspectives are presented you sense the author is honest and authentic due to a personal story included to illustrate her point.If you are anticipating a holiday family fall-out this year due to differing political or religious views...or if FOX ""news"" is better than any other of the million ""news"" networks... or if you are a part of a religious congregation or denomination that struggles to relate, buy this for yourself. (NOTE: She even explains why the ""agree to disagree"" position is a poor choice.)Read (or listen) to it...twice. It will honestly help you to just shut-up when conversation around you dives straight into the abyss. Why? Because this books creates an understanding of why people act out toward those whom they disagree. I feel that if we can understand why, we may be less reactionary..... and be able to listen.",215,ebook
Very insightful. Truly valuable work that I am already applying in my daily life. Thank you Brene.,216,ebook

"Braving The WildernessThe Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone  By Brene BrownReviewed by Jay GilbertsonTo be honest, the title threw me, the second one more effectively describes what this book is really about. Author Brown is no stranger to self-help books and happens to be good friends with the queen of self-help, Oprah, and a regular guest on her show. The book<U+2019>s main thrust is of our need to belong, how it was lost and ways to find it again. Given the increasing numbers of Americans suffering from loneliness, this topic is extremely important for all of us to look at more closely. Brown is a qualitative grounded theory researcher. It<U+2019>s a pretty vague job description and allows her to mush together many different forms of research and gear it to her own goal. In this particular book, her focus was on <U+201C><U+2026>trying to understand what we call the main concern of study participants. When it comes to belonging<U+2026>What are people trying to achieve? What are they worried about? They want to be a part of something<U+2014>to experience real connection with others<U+2014>but not at the cost of their authenticity, freedom, or power.<U+201D> One of the main issues so many she interviewed expressed was that of being <U+2018>spiritually disconnected,<U+2019> a diminishing sense of shared humanity. What seems to bind us together now is shared fear and disdain, not common humanity, shared trust, respect or love. Emerging from their responses, four elements of what Brown describes as <U+2018>true belonging.<U+2019>1. People Are Hard to Hate Close Up. Move In.2. Speak Truth to BS. Be Civil.3. Hold Hands. With Strangers.4. Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.Early on I was a little concerned as to exactly what was intended by spirituality. In no way is this meant as anything remotely related to any particular religion. Brown is careful to define it as recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to each other by a power greater than all of us, and our connection to that power and to one another is grounded in love and compassion, a cornerstone of some, but not all religions.Once it became clear that this was a universal all-encompassing concept that we all, as humans, crave<U+2014>to belong<U+2014>it was simply a matter of defining how we became so separated from one another.<U+201C>In the case of the United States, our three greatest fault lines<U+2014>cracks that have grown and deepened due to willful neglect and a collective lack of courage<U+2014>are race, gender, and class.<U+201D>The <U+2018>cracks<U+2019> that have driven a wedge into the basic reason we are experiencing such a major shift away from belonging is something we are all very familiar with. From Black Lives Matter to all the bathroom issues to the One-Percenters, we are overwhelmed with messages and constant reminders of our vast differences.The majority of the book focuses on an expansion of the four elements mentioned earlier and is well worth exploring. However, it could have been edited into a much shorter read as several of the antidotes loll into lecture-mode and had me skimming. The bottom line is something we all know to be true and the main reason there is a collective, soul-deep desire to belong.<U+201C>We are wired for connection. But the key is that, in any given moment of it, it has to be real.<U+201D>As in person, not online. Imagine that.<U+2022> Hang-up and hang-out<U+2022> Re-join offline living<U+2022> Show up, in person",222,ebook
Wow! Powerful book! I'm so inspired!!!,223,ebook
I've read every book of hers and loved it. This one said nothing to me. Rather disappointed :(,224,ebook
Love it. This book really hits home right now with everything going on in our country. Highly recommend!,225,ebook
"i have purchased everyone of her books and just loved them.this one seems to wane towards the end and the author is having a hard timegetting the meat out.  she relies on information from her old books, which are fantastic,but i don't want to read them again.  i think she misses the mark with this book.",226,ebook
"Very relevant, thought provoking and rooted in research as always with Brene's work.",227,ebook
Brene does it again! What a beautiful book on how challenging the spiritual growth path is and how we can continue to connect. A must read for anyone that wants to live an authentic life and preserve your relationships with everyone around you!,228,ebook
Brene Brown does not dissappoint in this great read about belonging!  Don't miss this inspiring thoughtful book that makes you want to brave the wilderness,229,ebook
Brene' Brown is the best!,230,ebook
Brene is awesome. This is good stuff here. Will make you a better person.,231,ebook
Love this and cannot get enough if Brene Brown.,232,ebook
"LOVE this book! On so many levels. She had me from the first chapter detailing her experiences with the Bear Cadettes. I have never heard articulated feelings I have felt my whole life. The quote from Maya Angelou completely resonated for me after Brene broke it down...belonging everywhere and nowhere has summed up my 50+ years on tjis earth. But I am so empowered knowing that there are others like me and instead of feeling like a misfit, I feel honored to be in their company. I have braved the wilderness my whole life, and I will continue to stand, speak and write my truth without apology. I feel emboldened to let myself shine as brightly as my Creator intended after reading this book. Brene, thank you from the bottom of my heart. If I ever get the pleasure of meeting you I think I would be in awe. I respect your work and your much needed voice! I believe everyone should read this latest book from Brene Brown.",233,ebook
Really great read.,234,ebook
"Brene<U+2019> Brown did not disappoint. I wanted to wait for the paperback version, but having read all of her books and knowing how spot on she is, well, there was no way I could wait. I<U+2019>m only on chapter 2 and I already have that wonderful sense of <U+201C>she gets me.<U+201D>",235,ebook
This book rings true at a spiritual level.,236,ebook
"I wasn't sure what to expect when this book was shared with me, but it's one of those non-fiction books that attempts to teach by example. Of all its elements, I felt the most important was the importance of respect--for oneself as well as for all others.It was easy to read, with no a hint of superiority (listen to me: I know what's best). Instead, the author connected as a real person. In most cases, I felt like we were in a conversation on a comfortable couch.Tacking divisiveness in today's polarized world took bravery and showed me how to communicate more effectively with people with whom I might disagree.It's worth your time.",237,ebook
Excellent! Everyone should read this. So inspiring.,238,ebook
Brene' is awesome and I have loved and read all of her books. She is so down-to-earth and real. Her work has been life-changing for me.,239,ebook
"F I N A L L Y. After nearly a year of processing, observing, and praying, Bren<U+00E9> Brown has once again given me the words I haven<U+2019>t been able to say. The message of this book is so, so important. We are scared, hurting, and polarized as a people. The strong emotional current of the <U+201C>if you<U+2019>re not with me, you<U+2019>re my enemy<U+201D> rally cry is only carrying us farther away from one another. My heart longs for another way. These words give me hope that it<U+2019>s possible.",240,ebook
What a great read! Couldn<U+2019>t put it down.,241,ebook
Absolutely a must read. Every one of her books opened my heart a little bit more to understanding courage and vulnerability. Grateful for what she teaches.,242,ebook
What an amazing BOOK - Every person in this planet should read it!,243,ebook
Bren<U+00E9> Brown is brilliant! Every audiobook I've listened to written by her has been invaluable to me. I have found her work to be both relatable and relevant. I recommend this and all of the work of DR. Brown to everyone. She is so on point.,244,ebook
"So timely. So important. Thanks, Brene, for being so brave.",245,ebook

This book is for anyone who thinks deeply about his/her strengths and desires to know/feel more!!  Thank you for this inspiration!,248,ebook
"This is the first of her books that I have read.  Perceiving vulnerability as courageous, recognizing our hunt for not belonging, not being accepted, practicing generosity and civility are not new concepts, but  I love the way she connects  them to authenticity and a wild heart!. A heartwarming read, offering a glimmer of hope for our world.",249,ebook
Love Brene and her books!,250,ebook
"I'm not sure how I ended up with this book. While I'm pretty sure I bought it, I don't know why.  I was more under the impression of it being about a literal wilderness, and perhaps being alone in said wilderness.Regardless, at first it was oddly fascinating, like a car crash.  Couldn't look away... but then it started getting circular.  In the author's defense, there are a few nuggets worth reading in this book, but not much more.I ended up not being able to finish this book.",251,ebook
"I can't be more disappointed with a purchase. Bought this book expecting a largely spiritual and hopefully enlightening read. Instead, got an earful of politics that I was completely NOT prepared for.I'm a huge fan of Brene. Not of politics. I'm not even American and I couldn't care less about what's going on over there! The advertising for this book is hugely misleading and I would ask for a refund if I could. Thankfully I bought this off a free credit on Audible. I deliberated giving Brene another shot with another of her books, but I couldn't bring myself to purchase a second one, and I probably won't do so again. I am a creative person and this audiobook was supposed to help me get in the zone while working on an art project. But it achieved the complete opposite and brought me entirely OUT of the zone. At Chapter 3, I sat for a good twenty minutes or so, listening to Brene's political ranting and preaching, and realised I hadn't taken in a word. It was such a painful experience that I didn't even want to give the rest of the chapters a chance.Brene is an amazing, inspiring person, but not so much this book of hers. If you have zero interest in politics (and most certainly not American politics!), maybe do yourself a favour and stay away.",252,ebook
"I didn't find too many new concepts here, which I haven't already picked up from joining a liberal and welcoming religious congregation. I think Dr. Brown is preaching to the choir. People who are open-minded and flexible (or want to be) will certainly read this book.  However, I think the real trick is to reach those who are close-minded, inflexible, judgmental, etc.  Will they even consider reading this book? Those are the people who should read this book, not those of us who already have beliefs in equality, justice, diversity, etc.",253,ebook
I love everything about this book.  Has really helped me manage this crazy political environment.,254,ebook
"What a powerful, true and kind book about how to be authentic. I great read.  Now I just need to actually be brave!",255,ebook
"I only met Brene on Ted talks. This book was a perfect follow up to Dan Rather's What Unites Us. Both call us to raise the bar on civility, humanity and using our brains and souls for better lives. Both should become required reading before you pass go and collect your first paycheck.Both call us on our soul sickness. Both have life altering suggestions for healing.",256,ebook
"I highlighted roughly 50% of this book - so many great, helpful insights on how to grow, mature, understand, communicate, and generally live a better, fuller, more authentic and genuine life!  Highly recommend.",257,ebook
"Braving the Wilderness is an engaging, passionate, and well structured book that took me by surprise. I didn't know anything about this book or the author when I grabbed this.The expression Braving the Wilderness immediately transported me to the middle of an inhospitable isolated place where we have to learn to survive on our own surrounded by dangerous beasts. In a way, this is a  metaphor for what braving the wilderness really is, it is just that is not Alaska or the Amazon but our modern day society, and our social and political environment, that we have to face and survive.The book departs from Maya Angelou's statement that we are only free when realize we belong to no place but to every place, to no place at all, and that the price we pay is high but the reward amazing. This is indeed the core around which Brown's discourse revolves. Braving the Wilderness is a book about connecting in healthy meaningful ways and belonging without trying too hard or expecting others to let us feel that we belong, to belong without belonging anywhere and everywhere, to belong to ourselves more and foremost.According to Brown, we all want to belong and connect, but doing so forgetting who we truly are, hiding who we are, faking who we are not, and not holding our ground or boundaries is not true belonging.  True belonging it is not based on somebody's else accepting us as much as accepting ourselves and showing who we are, what we believe, and what we think even when we are surrounded by people or situations that are hostile to us and our survival instinct pushes us to conform, shut up or fake it up. Braving the wilderness demands from us to speak our minds, disclose what we believe, do not obscure what it really matters to us, and how we see or feel anything, no matter the consequences.In Braving the Wilderness, Brown discusses spirituality, loneliness, aloneness, solitude, conflict, true belonging, stereotyping, compassion, connection, empathy, fear, hatred, alienation, pain, anger, BS, civility, boundaries, the difference between what we are and what we believe, and between fitting and belonging. And the good thing is that she does it with a lot of soul and in a very clear, understandable engaging way.I enjoyed her comments on stereotyping and crap talk, and on bringing civility back into fashion. However, one of the things that resonated the most with me was the  BRAVING system, or seven rules to trust people, ourselves, and be trusted: 1/ Boundaries. 2/ Reliability.  3/ Accountability. 4/ Vault; to be like a vault, a sort of my lips are sealed. 5/ Integrity. 6/ Non Judgement. 7/ Generosity;  assume that everybody's words and intentions meant to be good even if they turned out otherwise.I also liked Brown's quest to be clear about what she means by what she says and, therefore, about defining precisely the words she uses in the book. The main definitions are for: >  Spirituality = in a nutshell, we are all interconnected. > Wilderness = in a nutshell, know who you are and dare to own it. > Braving = in a nutshell, be brave to say what you believe and stand for. > True Belonging = in a nutshell, let your inner light shine and go out even when when others don't really like it. > Civility = in a nutshell, treat others the way you want to be treated even when you strongly disagree with them.THE DOWNSIDES1/ Extroversion biasThe quest to belong is common to all humans, no matter our culture, nationality, ideology and religion, but the way people connect are not the same. Brown has a strong extroversion bias, and she projects her extroversion as an equivalent of connection. Any introvert reading the book will find that there are too many groups, too many get-together, and some large gatherings that are not ''natural' ways of connecting to us. Most introverts I know would avoid large gatherings at all, and I don't mean concerts in big arenas or football matches, but large family gatherings, and yet, they have meaningful connections with other human beings and empathy with humanity in general. Of course, when we attend a wedding or funeral, or march in the streets to express our views on social or political issues we are sharing important things with strangers, we are part of something larger than ourselves, but to introverts that is not real connection. I would like that some writers thought about introverts who are functional human beings but don't relate to other people as extroverts do. I am not saying that Brown doesn't get that, I am saying that the book doesn't reflect that.2/ Braving the wilderness is not enough.We can brave the wilderness, but for society to be better, to step up, to change as a hole, more is needed. I don't deny the power of one or a few to transform society, but a large shift is needed to do that, and that involves more that a good heart, belonging to ourselves, or loving our neighbour. The  power of education, social justice, eradication of poverty and equal opportunities are immense to eradicate ignorance, fear, hatred and swallowing the news as they were holy books, so people aren't manipulated, and hatred and antagonism don't spread so easily and virulently.3/ Data per se is not serious research.I understand that this is a book addressed to the general public, and Brown couldn't mention her research's methodology and findings in detail. However, the book sounded as if she was reducing research to data. Data alone is easily manipulable and data is not a poll in which x percent of a group says yes, no, or this is what I think about this issue. Brown is an academic and knows that perfectly well. However, at times, it sounded as if the data was just  the result of a poll taken among the people taken part in her research As I did read this book in audible format, there might be some explanations or footnotes in the hard-copy; if that is the case, my apologies in advance.4/ It might age soon.Although I agree with what she says about the current political environment in the US, I would have rather focused on other examples, which are equally valid, but won't age the book. On the other hand, she is braving the wilderness and speaking her truth, so bravo.5/ The first chapter.The start of the book got me worried. It is a sort of memoir in which Brown links her personal experiences to the core of the book, but until that becomes clear, it felt as another motivational self-centred guru wanting to talk about her without stop and dropping Oprah's name to major impact.THE AUDIBLE EDITIONBraving the Wilderness is spoken in a straightforward way, no euphemisms at all, very well structured and presented, so it is easy to follow even on audible format. Something that I don't take for granted. Brown is a wonderful speaker and reads her own book as if she was talking to you, not following something that has already been written. She has a mix of passion and softness, a great voice, tone and inflections, and a very good reading pace, so the result is an engaging discourse, which makes listening to this book a truly enjoyable experience.This is one of those audiobooks that one wants to listen to more than once, or even purchase the hard-copy or  Kindle<U+00A0>Braving the Wilderness: The quest for true belonging and the courage to stand alone<U+00A0>to re-read it.",258,ebook

great tool of information in this book,260,ebook
"Lots of deep insights that resonated with me, and I will take with me moving forward. I just wanted some more specific ideas on integrating the book's powerful themes into daily life. Overall, very powerful findings, and Dr. Brown's tenacity shines and grabs the reader throughout.",261,ebook
"Can relate to many of the stories in this book...especially the drill team experience. Took lots of notes...this book just may be a road map toward greater ""true"" connection and the formula for being brave. This is a book I will keep and read again!",262,ebook
Very good book. It talks about a lot or different areas we can all do to improve not only our life but the would around us as well. READ IT.,263,ebook

Excellent book which speaks into the mess we find ourselves in. Amazing research and great application. It is making a difference in my life.,267,ebook
"AS usual, Bren<U+00E9> Brown does not disappoint.  The idea that we may have to go it alone sometimes to succeed is key, and balancing this with our human need of belonging is vital for our own and society<U+2019>s health.",268,ebook
"In this age of disconnection  how do we find belonging ?  Dr. Bren<U+00E8> Brown presents practical  tools for finding a way to belong to yourself first, then to each other.The premise of the  book is the wilderness is the place we step out from the crowd and  stand alone in our integrity . Hard to do  its a thankless place sometimes but if we rare willing to risk not fitting in, we will find out how to belong to our own hearts.One quote that resonated with me: the more we diminish our own pain, or rank it compared to what others have survived, the less empathic we are to everyone.Feeling pain is part of our journey.  The only way to sit in pain and grief with another, away from the crowd,  is if we are willing to feel our own. I strongly recommend  ""Braving The Wilderness"" for anyone who has hurt, has ft the pain of not fitting in,and those who want to provide safe places for others to find emotional  safety.",269,ebook
"A much needed book by an author who is never afraid to call it as she sees it. This book has some great insights and the typical hard hitting raw writing that we've come to expect from this incredibly talented researcher, writer, professor, and more.I like to read things that I agree with and things that I don't agree with because the former gives me inspiration and the latter helps me grow. I am never sure which kind Brown's books are ,which is probably the way she wants it. She calls us to rediscover civility and courage, and we need both.",270,ebook
"I started listening to this book in Audible and at first thought was highly promising. But for a researcher that does grounded theory, after a while she was preaching too much and not letting her research speak. She could have said the same thing in one page. I am sympathetic for some of her assertions, and indeed there is a strong need for all of us to be more authentic and think and act more upon our ""true belonging,"" but  I was tired of listening to the tirade after too many words about her and her views.",271,ebook

"We are our own story.  Be brave enough to share it with others.  By sharing your story, you will encourage another to do the same.  This is a very healing experience.We all want to belong but first and foremost we have to belong to our-self, our true self.We waste a lot of time hemming and hawing before we go into action.  For some of us it takes a whole lifetime before we get the courage to go forth and make changes for the better.  We so love to just dilly dally around the issues, not certain if we will be accepted or rejected for our vulnerability.Brene Brown doesn't mince any words if you are up to the challenge, this book is for you. I don't belong anywhere, if I don't belong to myself.The price is high, the reward is great.  "" I am the wilderness""",274,ebook

"This seems like the culmination of what she's been working on all this time, and everyone will benefit from giving it deep consideration.  It is so tempting and easy to align with a path that is already well travelled, especially by those we call friends and colleagues.  So easy to blame the ""other"" for all that is not the way we want it.  It is uncomfortable, but really mind-expanding, to realize that ""they"" actually make some valid points, and to take them seriously.  The peak of this awareness for me came from when I felt like I actually understood what Trump was trying to get at when he said ""both sides"" were responsible for the Charlottesville disaster, or at least what he might have meant in his own tone deaf and clumsy way: the ""anti-racists"" can easily become violent too!  We must embrace nonviolence if we hope to end violence.  I expect I will be condemned for this point of view and that is exactly what Brene is talking about.  There is good in the worst of us and bad in the best of us, and until we really accept that we are just going to be part of the problem.",280,ebook
"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, what was showcased as a self-help book for how to stand on your own, actually turned out to be a politically biased, opinionated novel lacking real data and facts. I had to stop halfway in because this book simply did not resonate - she tries to associate loneliness and <U+201C>not fitting in<U+201D> to the current political climate, with a very one- sided perspective. Most of the tangents she goes on do not even tie back to the original theme of the book. I<U+2019>m sure some of her other work is great, but this was disappointing.",281,ebook
"Braving, the only choice that makes sense. Brene teaches and shows us how.",282,ebook

"I bought Brene Brown<U+2019>s book Braving the Wilderness, more than a month ago, and finally cracked it open. It was weirdly calling to me. If you love a good book, you know this is true. This book has had me laughing, and crying. Not in the blubbering, lose your stuff kind of way, but the holy crap I needed to read this kind of way. Homeschooling is hard because you come face to face with yourself, and every anxiety, fear, and unworthy thought you ever had. You can<U+2019>t run from it. You see it as you try desperately to make sure your child is happy, that they belong, and that they matter.Holy goodness, that is a lot of pressure for the whopping annual salary of $0.00 a year. Reading this book allows you to see past the teaching part of homeschooling to the belonging part of homeschooling. <U+201C>Don<U+2019>t study this moment. Be in it.<U+201D> Okay, now I am mad. I needed to read that. You can read the rest of my review on my blog, but I will leave you with this final thought.

In the current climate of politics and parenting, it<U+2019>s easy to have armor on, to stay in a safe place and dehumanize those we disagree with, to want our kids to just fit in and have easier lives.But encouraging a wild and tender heart, recognizing belonging is where you truly love who you are, that leaning in to those you disagree with the most vehemently... those are the changes we all can make to create a Wilderness of love, light, and those who are making a difference and creating change.An awesome read. Highly recommended!",310,ebook
Perhaps I've read one too many of her books but there is nothing new here.  In future I'll pass.,311,ebook
Just what I needed,312,ebook
"This book could be transformational, if you let it...truly engaging and uplifting. Highly recommended for anyone, I'll give it to my daughter next.",313,ebook
"Bought this for my wife, and she hasn't been able to put it down! Highly recommended",314,ebook
"I just love brene. So anything she writes I<U+2019>m sprinting to. This one was different than the rest of her books. It challenged us to think outside ourselves and see the world as belonging. Exactly what I needed. You light up my life, Brene. I wish to be a piece of this to others in the world. I love your heart, your words, and for you being YOU.",315,ebook
"I was thoroughly impressed with the content of this book and the way Brene<U+2019> delivered it in written form. I do believe this content that was presented can change your life, but you better be ready to change and and have an open mind, because it is not going to be easy. Deep down we all have the ability to Live strong, and brave the wilderness.",316,ebook
must read !,317,ebook
Very good book. My first experience with Brene Brown and it is so positive.  Thought provoking. Souls searching. Looking at people and events from a different perspective for yourself.Part of a study group which makes it even better. Would highly recommend this to anyone trying to stay above the fray in today's current economic and political climate.,318,ebook
"It's ok, more of the same. Not one of her best works.  I am a big Brene Brown fan.  Her earlier works are better.  Seems like she is pulling from recent works to keep writing books.  A few new concepts yet nothing earth shattering.",319,ebook
Excellent!,320,ebook
"I haven't read her other books (not yet, at least) but in this book, Ms. Brown sounds like a prophet for our times. She points out the dehumanizing tendencies of our current political and social scene. She shares how to disagree and negotiate with civility so we can hear each other and move forward. I intend to make use of the questions she suggested we use in situations of disagreement: ""Tell me more."" and ""Help me understand how you feel about this."" She shows how to lead from ""true belonging"" in uncertainty and risk with emotional openness, with both full conviction and humility.",321,ebook
"A thoughtful discussion on what it truly means to belong. Learning through listening and respectful, civil living.  Uplifting and hopeful.  Useful and essential strategies for ""braving the wilderness "".  Thank you Brene!",322,ebook
Insightful and helpful!,323,ebook
"I trust Brene' Brown's research and experiences.  This book could be the roadmap to reversing the deleterious path being cultivated today in politics, race relations, religion, and the widening chasm between the ""have's"" and ""have-nots.""  I encourage everyone who thinks they might have a strong back, soft front, and wild heart to explore braving their own wilderness and maybe even change the world.",324,ebook
Brene Brown is as authentic as it gets. She could be my best friend. Transparency at its best! This is an important book.,325,ebook
"Didn't know that I was going to get so much insight, strength and courage, but from this book, I did.",326,ebook
Awesome Brene<U+2019> Work again. She never loses a step. Love her and this proves why!,327,ebook
"Bren<U+00E9> Brown is a sage femme in my life. Great new work from her, every page has a nugget to live and love by!",328,ebook
So empowering and insightful,329,ebook
Brene Brown is an amazing woman and writer. She lets us in on what it takes to walk the walk of truth telling and loving authentically. Thank you for the reminders and practices of being wholehearted!,330,ebook
"I listened to Joshua Johnson interview Brene Brown on NPR and knew I had to buy this book. I've been reading it and absorbing the wisdom offered, and I highly recommend it. It is transformational. And at $16 it is $12 less than in the stores. Just awesome.",331,ebook
good quality,332,ebook
Love this book on tape!,333,ebook
"Loved Brene Brown's style the 1st 20 times I heard her share personal stories and say how well her data supports everything she is finding.  Have been waiting for the non-personal evidence to be shared/cited, but it is all stories about ""Brene's insight and experience""  Great, but not science.  Should stop representing herself as a ""scientific qualitative researcher"" if she is only going to editorialize about the research, rather than share the research.",334,ebook
Amazing book!!,335,ebook
Amazing book,336,ebook
Love it!,337,ebook
Excellent read and excellent information very well written - a different level of inspiration,338,ebook
Brene never disappoints.,339,ebook
In true Bren<U+00E9> Brown fashion...she is brilliant! I wish I could buy them by the 100's and pass them out with well written messages inside.,340,ebook
"Thank YOU, Brene'!!! I read your very powerful book from cover to cover last month as I celebrated my 60th birthday. I was moved, inspired, curious about my own 'belonging' conversations, ruthless about my own privilege conversations, and hopeful about humanity ... especially with leadership like yours!!Dr. Maya Angelou was right when she said to you, ""You're doing important work. Keep doing it. Keep talking about your work. Don't stop and don't let anyone get in your way.""  Thank you! Thank you!! Thank you!!!!!<U+0001F49E><U+0001F496><U+0001F917>",341,ebook
I just love Brene<U+2019>. Yet another great look into the real stuff that makes us actually live authentic lives...and the hiding that kills our true self.,342,ebook
"Brene did it again. She gave me language for my own experience, tools for my journey towards wholeness & courage. I love how she shares more about her own story in this book.<U+00A0> One of the bravest things I think Brene does is neither painting herself as the hero or the villain, but simply human. Some of her stories she practices courage and kindness; sometimes she does not. And I respect her all the more for sharing both kinds of stories. She says some uncomfortable, good things especially in today's political climate; but I think that's exactly why they are so brave AND necessary to say. I don't think I agree all of Brene's own political views (she hints at some of her views), but I can appreciate how respectfully she treats those on both sides of the debate, not shaming others for thinking differently. I truly believe that we need Jesus for the changes she speaks of making, otherwise I fear they will only be behavioral changes and not reach our heart. I would have loved to see her share about<U+00A0>how we find the power to actually do this, which I believe is only found in Jesus. Even so, I think she speaks much-needed truth & am so grateful for her book.<U+00A0>A for me.<U+00A0>",343,ebook
Moving!!,344,ebook
Another great book from Brene,345,ebook
This is Brene Brown's third book and I truly am inspired and grow from each book.,346,ebook

Beautiful.,349,ebook
I can hear Berne Brown<U+2019>s voice as I read these pages.  A very good read. Thank you.,350,ebook
Excellent book for anyone dealing with shame issues and tryingto get their life more open and honest.  Ms. Brown writes verywell -- sometimes more scholarly than I like  (I have to go backand re-read a paragraph) but that just means I get the opportunityto learn and remember.,351,ebook
All of Brene<U+2019>s stuff is amazing! I love her!,352,ebook
Excellent! Her writings are always so worthwhile.,353,ebook
"Read this. Practice this. Live this. Sharing this with your family,friends, and all institutions(especially our politicians) will change our world.",354,ebook

Bren<U+00E9> helps me to find strength in my trying and uncertain times. Thank you for your courage and willingness to be the light as I create my own path.,357,ebook
This is the best of Brene<U+2019>s books yet. Must read and a bible. Am now during my second reading. Still amazing,358,ebook
"Right ON, Sister! This is such an important body of work. Thank you for the examples so that we may better understand how to use the tools in our own lives--which I intend to do while I listen to the book several more times! This is exactly what I've been needing in my life: a guide to a more loving heart. Thank you, Bren<U+00E9>.",359,ebook
I have been a Brene Brown fan for years and was thrilled to see she'd come out with a new book. This one is so encouraging for the times we live in. I just wish everyone would read it and heed it! I have a feeling I'm going to read it again and again.,360,ebook
"Powerful, especially with Brene reading it on Audible! Very insightful.",361,ebook
"Excellent read, she is honest and soulful, I can<U+2019>t wait to read her previous books",362,ebook
Insanely interesting and timely book - such hope and practical wisdom. Thank you!,363,ebook
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!! Too much to include every ahh haaa great read.,364,ebook
al;ways love what Brene Brown has to say,365,ebook
So many great moments.,366,ebook
A friend gave me this book because she knew I was in an emotional crises over recent events where I was de-valued by a group that I thought defined me and I <U+201C>thought<U+201D> I needed to be a member.Easy read and a powerful revelation for personal strength and empowerment. Brene Brown nailed it with describing how we feel when we think we don<U+2019>t belong. Her solution is positive and easily translates to practical life changes. She validated my discomfort and helped me to understand why I felt the way I did.,367,ebook
"I can't get past how timely this book is for our modern societal ailments. Please read it. I'll be rereading it soon. For now, I am the wilderness.",368,ebook
This was the first book I have read by Dr. Brown and it was wonderful. Very relatable and inspiring.,369,ebook
"Another incredible resource for whole hearted living by Dr. Brene Brown. Words seem to fail my experience , but the tears and laughter I experienced through this literary adventure stand as testaments for the power of the wonderful Dr. Brene Brown.",370,ebook
Good book,371,ebook
"Everyone should read this book, life changing",372,ebook
"This was the book that she was born to write. I cried through most of it, because everything her soul is saying here was deeply moving to the ache that has been in my soul the last year.Thank you Brene. Just thank you!",373,ebook
"I love how Brene Brown has transformed vulnerability into courage to find one's voice.  To speak truth into difficult situations. And to recognize our world is full of contradictions, and it is OK.  Reality is not ideological black and white, whether it's politics, religion or whatever topic is the focus of the day. Reality is our complex human experience and let's honor its complexity with truth, courage, love and kindness.  And Brene gives us the tools and strength to do so to contribute to a better world.  Thank you Dr. Brown.",374,ebook
"Storytelling that you relate to, and deep research that makes you believe in being you with all the courage and vulnerability that requires",375,ebook
Everyone should read this book and follow its content to understand how each of us can create a kinder and gentler world.  It turns out the door to peace and harmony is a do-it-yourself project.  Thank you BRENE<U+2019>,376,ebook
"Excellent read!  The book and Audible are ""spot on"".",377,ebook
"I will be listening to this again and again.  I love the way Brene offers specific solutions to try and how she is willing to be honest with struggles most of us can relate to.  This book also gets in to how to deal with the division our country is experiencing in a way that maintains dignity, truth, integrity and is effective.",378,ebook
"Raise your hand if you're like me and refuse to get vulnerable in real life <U+0001F64B><U+0001F3FB> Bren<U+00E9> Brown speaks to my soul in this one, even in those short moments when I don't think I quite agree. This is likely the most relatable book I've read in a long time.  She details true belonging through the lens of vulnerability (her main subject if you've ever seen her TED Talk), the importance of connecting face to face, and braving the wilderness - aka having the courage to always be yourself.  Spoiler alert, ""BRAVING"" is an acronym.",379,ebook
Amazing.,380,ebook
"I really wanted to like this book.  I have read all of Brene<U+2019>s past books multiple times.  Each book is like eating an elephant of wonderful data and introspection, filled with life giving challenges and hope.  Each of my copies have hundreds of notes and highlights in them. I have even taught and entire men<U+2019>s retreat on Vulnerability, and it was wonderful.  This book though, I am not sure what <U+201C>mark<U+201D> she was trying to hit with it, but in my opinion it didn<U+2019>t hit any mark.  Half of the book is simply other famous people<U+2019>s stories/research proving her points, very few stories of actual participants, save one memorable one about a guy berating his father right after he promised to be kinder to him.  The rest of book is completely uncharacteristic of her depth and wisdom and feels really shallow and overly politicized.  I feel this book was rushed, the data she didn<U+2019>t really know as well, and the point was missed.  I sense that running the four companies now that she talks about in the book have diluted the ability to really focus on life changing writing, which is her gift, in my opinion.  I will now go back and read The Gifts of Imperfection again.",381,ebook
Braving is an amazing journey,382,ebook
"Bren<U+00E9> (I feel like we are on a first name basis <U+0001F642>) writes in a way that makes the reader feel as if you<U+2019>re on a journey together and there<U+2019>s no one you<U+2019>d rather be adventuring with. Her writing feels so authentic because of her commitment to enter the fray and to try to practice the concepts she shares. This book is no exception. I was particularly moved by the sections on holding hands with strangers and on having a wild heart/ being the wilderness. If it means creating the kind of connection to others that I feel when I read this and Bren<U+00E9><U+2019>s other books, and that I get to go to that wilderness dance party; I<U+2019>m in! If you<U+2019>re looking for a quick fix to fit in better; you should pass on this book. But if you are interested in learning about how to show up with your whole true self and how to help others do the same; this book is the real deal. It gets my highest recommendation.",383,ebook
This should be required reading for humanity,384,ebook
"Amazing. I usually take around 4 weeks to finish a book, however this book took me 3 days. Absolutely worth the read, teaches you a lot more about yourself and life than anything.",385,ebook
One of the most timely and inspiring books I have read this year - so much truth in these pages! I love Brene<U+2019>s stories and explanations and openness to learning from her own research.,386,ebook
Love it,387,ebook
I highly recommend Brene's books to anyone who wants to grow. Her wisdom and research has changed my life. One of my favorite authors!,388,ebook
"Being a fan of Brene Brown<U+2019>s previous books, I expected this one to be good. I definitely did not expect it to hit home so hard.Multiple times when reading this book I had to put it down, close my eyes and reflect.Although written in an easy to read way, this was not an easy read. It was not easy because with everything that is happening in the US and worldwide, with the mess on both national and international political scene, the hate people give to one another, I also got pulled into taking sides. It is so easy to disagree with anyone whose opinion differs from our own. It is so easy to become obsessed with the political drama and point fingers at the <U+2018>bad guys<U+2019>. This book changed me.""The goal is to get to the place where we can think, I am aware of what<U+2019>s happening, the part I play, and how I can make it better, and that doesn't mean I have to deny the joy in my life.""Braving the Wilderness is an eye opener.""Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization. And social media are the primary platforms for our dehumanizing behavior. On Twitter and Facebook we can rapidly push the people with whom we disagree into the dangerous territory of moral exclusion, with little to no accountability, and often in complete anonymity.""Brene touches upon all the topics that divide our society, if not the world: 2016 US election, the disrespect between Republicans and Democrats, all possible aspects of racism, gun laws, the way social media and anonymity makes it easy to express hateful opinions. But this is not a book about Democrats, Republicans, Whites or Blacks. This is a book about people <U+2013> human beings coming together, coexist peacefully and get along.It challenges everything we think we know about belonging, not only on the personal level, but also much broader spectrum <U+2013> the country, our communities, and our cultures.Brene focuses on basic rules, which may not speak to you when you look at them briefly, but make so much sense when you open your mind and think about them deeply.""People are hard to hate close up. Move in.""""Speak truth to BS. Be Civil.""""Hold hands. With strangers.""""Strong back. Soft front. Wild heart.""Recommended read for everyone!",389,ebook
Very very nice book!! Lived reading it,390,ebook
"Brene Brown speaks from the heart and from the research about the polarization of this country, the disconnection we are experiencing and the path back to true belonging. Once again, Brene Brown will knock your socks off.",391,ebook
It's Brene Brown -- always a good read.,392,ebook
"Brene Brown<U+2019>s books call us to question our beliefs about our work, our families & our selves like no other author is doing. This book is just one step further down the path of helping all of us individually & collectively become our best selves.  Very readable & lots of actionable advice. Highly recommended.",393,ebook
This is exactly what all humankind need right now.  In our times of division Brene shows us how we can begin to come together again without giving up who we are.  Excellent!,394,ebook
"I've run hot and cold on Brown's previous books. This one stood out as strong for me. It left me with a few good questions (like why aren't people curious anymore when they have more information at their fingers than ever before). I also walked away reading it with concrete things to try. Overall, very easy, pleasurable read.",395,ebook
"Bren<U+00E9> Brown is the best! I love all her books! This one is amazing! Her research is top notch and relevant for the times that we're living in! If everyone read her books, the world would be a healthier place. I've always felt like I was braving the wilderness, even more so now that I'm a nomad! Love you, Bren<U+00E9>!",396,ebook
"I<U+2019>ve said it once, and I<U+2019>ll say it again - Bren<U+00E9> Brown<U+2019>s work really should be required for all humans. This book was nothing short of amazing. Covers the longing for true connection we all have, how to lean in to standing alone, and surprisingly  is almost like a guide book for the times we are currently in as a nation.  This woman is the real deal.",397,ebook
"I love Brene Brown<U+2019>s Work, and was so excited to read this new book.  Some of it was very good and insightful.  I respect the message she was trying to convey.  But during much of the book I felt like she was preaching, not teaching.  And it often felt like she was scolding her readers. In her other books, she teaches through storytelling and many examples.  This book lacked that element for the most part, and I missed that.  There was a good message to the book, but it didn<U+2019>t touch me as much as her other books.",398,ebook
"Dr Brown combines her education, research and journey through her own life experiences to help display, explore and learn some skills for resolving those feelings, conflicts, quandaries and questions about life we all experience.  Reading her books always adds a depth to my own knowledge in this area and I have been a practicing psychiatrist/psychotherapist  for about 40 years.  It is very informative and yet written in a style that is easy for anyone to understand and learn from.",399,ebook
Her best book yet! Highly recommend.,400,ebook
Life changing,401,ebook
Amazing. So many lessons. I loved every moment reading this book.,402,ebook

Wonderful insight into some of life's journeys!,406,ebook
Love Love Love Brene Brown!!!,407,ebook
"I have always loved Brene Brown's matter of fact style and openness, but this book is by far my favorite!  She truly holds no punches and bares her soul as the writes the exact book needed in our country at this time.  I saw so much of myself and my story in her stories and everything in the book can be directly applied to my life.  When I finished, Braving the Wilderness, I felt ""this is who I am and where I am headed"".  There is no book more relevant to each and every one of us.  No matter what walk of life you are from, it will help you find the beauty in your own wilderness and find the courage and strength to live more authentically than you ever have.  I cannot recommend this book more highly!",408,ebook
My first Brene Brown book and I couldn't put it down!  It made me realize many things about myself.  Thank you for writing this.,409,ebook
Another success Brene! <U+2764><U+FE0F>,410,ebook
I love the way the idea of wilderness came full circle.  What begins as a wasteland becomes a necessary port of self discovery and integrity.,411,ebook
"As usual, Brene Brown delivers another excellent book!",412,ebook
"I  bought this book because the author was interviewed on CBS Morning News. She is impressive but the book is not. She writes over and over again about ""research"" but her ""research"" is investigating such nebulous terms as ""true belonging"" or ""integrity"" without presenting what researchers typically do: define your terms objectively and measurably, undertake a scientific sample, specify your research procedures and instruments, etc. Consequently, this book should not be taken as social science research findings. Some ideas seem thoughtful and reasonable but the findings are not bona fide ""research"" findings.",413,ebook
This is the best Brene Brown book so far!!,414,ebook
Excellent read.,415,ebook
"Love the newest book from Bren<U+00E9>!! I am finding this very inspiring and also full of down-to-earth information about belonging, being in community and braving the wilderness to stand alone too!!  (I read it during a family vacation to Kona!)",416,ebook
"Besides the fact that Brene' is absolutely amazing and tells things as they are, this book is probably my top favorite she has written! So much truth and so many things that I was needing to hear and also felt understood and validated. I have recommended and told many folks that this is a must read!",417,ebook
"Is this the cure for cancer? No. It's the ice pick of data necessary to begin chipping away at the frozen clusters of behaviors we've adopted in the name of self-preservation or power.All one has to do is stroll through through pages of book reviews to see how comfortable we've become as human beings at criticizing the driving skills of others, when most likely we've never had the balls to get behind the wheel ourselves. Thank God, Brene is ballsy and willing to share the research.Everyone who is deeply concerned with the state of the world around us - the social structure we will be leaving our children and grandchildren should read this.Everyone who is wounded by the sickening divide and rising toxicity levels in human relationships and public discourse should read this.Everyone who holds inside themselves even a flicker of hope for a world filled with mature and compassionate love, common decency, true humanity, social justice or equality should read thisEveryone who just wants to be brave, authentic to themselves and other humans - should read this.Bravo, Brene! You are one brave gal and I am grateful.",418,ebook
"A timely look at the importance of communicating courageously and courteously, especially when society faces deep divisions.",419,ebook
This book has thought me to be a better person. Well worth your time!,420,ebook
"I<U+2019>m another clumsy reviewer; but felt I must join in with my thoughts. Most reviewers of this book felt it wasn<U+2019>t up to the standards of the author<U+2019>s previous books. Never having read her before, I can only say I feel very sad for her; that is, that she didn<U+2019>t feel confident enough to be her own person in her earlier years. I felt this book was very preachy and repetitive. Yes, some of it resonated (her thoughts on the negative social and political climate aspects in our world); but in my world, more people are understanding of others opposing viewpoints and willing to listen(if not agree) , than she would lead us to believe.This book made me feel quite impatient with the author.",421,ebook
"I love her writing and find her messaging very inspirational. This was not my favorite book though, since I found it a little more preachy and more geared toward the current political climate. I was expecting it to be a bit more self-help and motivational than it was.  Overall happy I read it, but could have waited for a library copy since this isn<U+2019>t one I will likely read again.",422,ebook
I was laughing out loud by page page 7 and openly weeping by page 20. Just buy it.,423,ebook
"Brene Brown continues to amaze me. She has such a powerful gift for not only research and results but taking both and putting the two into words that matter. Instead of her findings being lonely words on a page, they are food for a hungry soul like me...someone who has felt shame, handed out shame, closed myself off, become vulnerable ... someone who is now asking herself, <U+201C>How am I loving a life of True Belonging? Have I ever lived a life of True Belonging or have I fooled myself all of this time and have instead been living a life of fitting in?<U+201D> I love that Brown puts these questions in my head. I think the thoughts are worth thinking and the answers worth finding...so much so that I believe my life will be better when I truly belong...to myself. Thanks Brene!",424,ebook
Bren<U+00E9> once again guides readers inward in order to learn why we are who we are. To embrace the gifts we have and share them with the world. #posttraumaticgrowth #grit,425,ebook
One of the most important read of our times.  This book has the ability to change the world if people will read it and put it's wisdom into practice.,426,ebook
"I absolutely love Brenee and her books have made a big difference in my life. Like her other books, this is also fun to read (I finished it in half a day) but I had already listened to her TED talk on the BRAVING model and, all the way to the end, I was left wanting something I wasn't getting ... it is as though she ran out of inspiration but needed to publish something. I was disappointed and even if she wanted it published, I would have preferred a $9.99 versus the $17 and, given the ton of excellent books that are coming out, I feel these are no longer times when you can publish something because your name will draw buyers. Next time she publishes I will wait until the book comes in library. I really, really wish I didn't have to write this kind of review for a Brenee book. And I still do love Brenee :)",427,ebook
I have read Brene 's books for several years. This is another one that has come along right when I need it. I long for authenticity and struggle with people pleasing. She always puts it out there and gets my brave out of hiding and nugdes me on my journey. My relationship with me is key.,428,ebook
"Eye opening. Heart felt.  Truth. Thank you, Bren<U+00E9> Brown.",429,ebook
Very well written and well read. I absolutely love it<U+2019>s message,430,ebook
A must read.,431,ebook
"I downloaded the sample of this book expecting to read a little bit of what the book was about. The sample starts with the opening credits, then a picture of a cut tree rings and the very next page is one sentence and then <U+201C>thank you for enjoying the sample<U+201D> this is truly just a sample. I only got to read one sentence out of the entire book? I<U+2019>d like to read at least a page or two to see what this book is about and if wanted to purchase and read more!",432,ebook
Brene is the BEST!,433,ebook
What a fabulous companion and friend this book has become for me as I am in the wilderness and found my guidebook,434,ebook
Brene Brown does it again! I'm biased because I'm obsessed with Brene Brown. But literally all her work is gold! You can't go wrong no matter which of her books you purchase. Take it from someone who has read every single one multiple times and gets something new out of them every time she does!,435,ebook
well written with some thoughtful research.  I relate and agree with 90% of Brown's ideas of living life. At times I felt she was writting about me.  A little bit of puffing about incounters with celebrities but it was good.,436,ebook
Must read for anyone who feels lonely in their spiritual/human journey when connecting with others.,437,ebook
I love Brene Brown.  Her researcher storyteller style is so incredible!  She touches your heart while teaching your brain. Perfect <U+0001F495><U+0001F496><U+0001F497><U+0001F618><U+0001F618><U+0001F618>,438,ebook
"I find huge benefit from Brene's work. I was introduced with her (then) new book, Rising Strong.  As soon as I was done, not having realized she published before Rising Strong, that I had to quickly buy her earlier books.  This new book is just as I would expect from Brene. I have been on a journey of self discovery and Brene is the single most valuable element of my making myself more real and true.",439,ebook
Another wonderful read by Brene.  She really hits the nail on the head with her outspoken honesty about today's society and what we need to do to heal.,440,ebook
"Bren<U+00E9> Brown has written three NY Times bestsellers. She also has one of the five most viewed TED talks with over 30 million views called <U+201C>The Power of Vulnerability.<U+201D>This book is about our yearning to belong and how having the courage to be ourselves, being authentic, and having the courage to stand alone can help us accomplish a sense of belonging. This sounds like quite a paradox, but Bren<U+00E9> brings clarity to this conundrum by the end of the book.BRAVING is an acronym that Bren<U+00E9> introduced in an earlier book called Rising Strong. It is about trusting others and self-trust. She calls this her wilderness checklist. Gaining this trust is about:<U+2022> Boundaries. This is making sure that we<U+2019>re clear on respecting boundaries, and when in doubt, we ask.<U+2022> Reliability. We do what what we say we are going to do.<U+2022> Accountability. We own our mistakes, apologize, and make things right.<U+2022> Vault. Simply keeping things in confidence and sharing only the things that are ours to share.<U+2022> Integrity. Practicing our values and always doing what is right even if it<U+2019>s uncomfortable.<U+2022> Non-judgment. We can differ in opinions and still respect each other.<U+2022> Generosity. We extend the most generous interpretation possible to the intentions, words, and actions of others.Our world is so polarized today. We tend to look at each other<U+2019>s differences. We separate ourselves with regards to politics, religion, social class, etc., and tend to gravitate towards those who think the same as us. Our differences are magnified more so today than at any other time in our history.Bren<U+00E9> gives us four elements to help with the reality of today<U+2019>s world. They are:1 - People Are Hard to Hate Close Up. Move In.2 - Speak Truth to BS. Be Civil.3 - Hold Hands. With Strangers.4 - Strong Back. Soft Front. Wild Heart.This book helps us understand that our imperfections, uniqueness, our fears, etc., are what make us who we are. Bren<U+00E9> says that once we embrace our humanness, our shortcomings, and we love ourselves for who we are, will we find our sence of belonging.This book was published September 12th, 2017 and already has 176 reviews on Amazon giving it a 4.6 rating. Goodreads gives it 4.32 stars after 2,433 ratings and 366 reviews. The timing of this book couldn<U+2019>t be more apropos with the divisiveness of our world today. I definitely recommend this one and I give it 4 stars.#FridaysFind #MIAGD #Bren<U+00E9>Brown #BRAVING #BravingTheWilderness #Authenticity #BeYou",441,ebook
"This book helped me look at my life experience & what I see that feels really edgy as I move in to doing important work in this big world. It goes beyond vulnerability or self-love to address feelings of loneliness & wanting to belong that can be the reason we betray ourselves, or the reason we partner, or hopefully the foundation for standing alone in our power like a beautiful tree.",442,ebook
"Absolutely phenomenal and timely, I cried, laughed, got nailed, was deeply empowered, and have already sent five of my friends on the quest to read it. There are so many important areas covered in this book, from how we dehumanize one another to how gossip is the toxic mimic of connection to how to be curious to being brave by being yourself. It should be required reading for everyone.",443,ebook
"Absolutely essential reading for anyone who doesn't feel like they fit in and that the world is crazy. We must ""brave the wilderness"". It's so important in healing our culture of divisiveness and hate. Thank you to Brene Brown for writing this book for all of us.",444,ebook
"New, fresh, timely information. As always, Brene challenges my thinking and behavior.",445,ebook
"Brene' hits the proverbial nail on the head with this one. There is so much wisdom touching on everything from where we've come as a society and the influence of social media on our civility to encouraging us to spend more time face to face embracing one another through the celebration and grieving rituals. She speaks of being authentic and true to ourselves even though it may lead us through the wilderness. It is there, in the wilderness, where we may find a whole new tribe. I purchased this through Audible, and I could not stop listening. I finished the listen in one afternoon. It has been a long time since I didn't become bored listening to a book. Brene' gets real on so many levels and it is inspiring and refreshing to listen to someone who is genuine and honest.",446,ebook
Brene speaks from the heart from a place of truth delivering the message that others have not! She inspires me to face my fears and move forward brave and strong even if I'm alone!!!,447,ebook

"Fans of self-help books seeing this book in their section of a bookstore or at the top of their Amazon search results might wonder what the wilderness that this book<U+2019>s title refers to, and how <U+201C>braving it<U+201D> will help them lead a better life, at least in ways that other self-help books do. Though it may not be apparent from the title, Brene Brown<U+2019>s most recent book, Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone, is indeed a self-help book of the best kind not only for the individual, but for society as a whole. One that is sorely needed, I might add.Brown<U+2019>s definition of the wilderness as a metaphorical place where <U+201C>belonging so fully to yourself that you<U+2019>re willing to stand alone<U+2026>[in] an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching<U+2026>,<U+201D> is one that can only be understood in the context of the rest of humanity: one cannot stand alone without a group of <U+201C>others<U+201D> to stand away from. This book is an explanation of how very much we all need one another, and to feel like we truly belong, and how sometimes, in order to get that feeling, ironically, we have to let it go. We have to be brave enough to be true to ourselves, to stand out in what could be a <U+201C>vast and dangerous environment<U+201D> in which we are alone and vulnerable, but also perhaps on an emotional or spiritual quest. <U+201C>Belonging,<U+201D> Brown says, <U+201C>is real connection that [isn<U+2019>t] at the cost of one<U+2019>s authenticity and identity, [and that acknowledges our] shared humanity. It<U+2019>s saying: <U+2018>we<U+2019>re different in many ways, but under it all, we are all inextricably connected in love and compassion.<U+201D>  The wilderness is <U+201C>a place of true belonging, and the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.<U+201D>This message really resonated with me, as I<U+2019>ve tried to wrap my brain and soul around the divisiveness and hate that are swarming the internet these days, and spilling out into real life in very hurtful, sometimes even deadly ways. It seems to me that this is caused, at least in part, by people who are trying to express themselves by tearing down others, in their own misguided attempts to <U+201C>belong to themselves.<U+201D> And it also seems that, if I may be so bold as to shrink the cause of all that into one small, all-inclusive phrase, many people are horrible at being civil, particularly online, and when people are voicing their opinions right and left with the microphone of social media at their mouths, again in an attempt to be true to themselves, but still not taking into account or inviting others to express theirs because they have yet to find or make a truly safe space on the internet. At a time when communication has never been so easy and had such a wide-ranging and immediate effect, we are still very much in our infancy in terms of communicating<U+2013>and thus, connecting<U+2013>with others online. The internet seems like it might be that wilderness, that place of danger and vastness. But it is not. the internet is the chaos of civilization, the thick of thrown words. The wilderness is the place one goes to clear one<U+2019>s head of that chaos, to plumb the depths of one<U+2019>s soul and find the courage to not only be comfortable with that soul, but to love that soul enough that you can love others. To truly belong.How Did She Determine How People Truly Belong?Discussing true belonging, Brown defined four main questions that she used to analyze data that she had gathered at the University of Houston about people who fit the profile of truly belonging:What is the process, practice, or approach that the women and men who have developed a sense of true belonging share in common?What does it take to get to the place in our life where we belong nowhere and everywhere, where belonging is in our heart and not something that others can hold hostage or take away, where belonging is not a reward for perfecting, pleasing, proving, and pretending?If we<U+2019>re willing to brave the wilderness to stand alone in our integrity, do we still need that sense of belonging that comes from community?that sense of belonging that comes from community?Does the current culture of increasing divisiveness affect our quest for true belonging? If so, how?Four Elements of True BelongingIn Braving the Wilderness, she found that, after analyzing her data and answering those questions, there were four elements of true belonging that she spends a good part of the book talking about:People are hard to hate close up. Move in. For those of you who are Christians, maybe this is why Jesus said that we should love our neighbors as ourselves (Mark 12:31). He didn<U+2019>t just say: <U+201C>love people.<U+201D>Speak truth to b.s. Be civil. This is Brown<U+2019>s wonderful, no-nonsense, even snarky way of saying <U+201C>it<U+2019>s not just about being nicer to people, on-line and off. It<U+2019>s about calling things out for what they are while still being respectful and maybe even constructive.<U+201D> For those of who wondering how to be civil, there<U+2019>s this wonderful book called Crucial Conversations that has some very good guidelines for that.Hold hands with strangers, which can be scary, especially if they have vastly different opinions and lifestyles. But we are all, ultimately, human, and will be able to find something in common. It takes an element of spirituality, which she defines as <U+201C>recognizing and celebrating that we are all inextricably connected to one another by a power greater than us.<U+201D>Strong back, soft front, wild heart. Strong spine, open mind, brave heart.Truly belonging, says Brown quoting Maya Angelou, is belonging <U+201C>everywhere and nowhere.<U+201D> It<U+2019>s a truly powerful dichotomy that I hope to one day experience.Ten stars, by the way. And then some. And I highly recommend you get the audiobook version, which Brown herself narrates.See my full review, as well as reviews of other books like this, at HeadOverBooks.com",450,ebook
Amazing!,451,ebook
Such an amazing read! Brene Brown never disappoints!,452,ebook
"Brene Brown is the Maya Angelou of our current time. She is grounded, authentic and provocative -- stating her truth in a way that helps us explore ours. Just as she references a quote Maya made many years prior, I have no doubt that years from now others will be quoting Brene in the same way. There are certain people put on Earth precisely to be doing the work that they are doing. Brene Brown is one of those truth-tellers whose uncomfortable words ultimately lead us on the only path to joy. This book is clear that work to create community will not be easy, but is so worth it.",453,ebook
"Brene's writing style always leaves me laughing, in tears, or contemplating how to make myself a better human being.  Her ability to tell stories about herself that I can relate to and see myself in is one of her best gifts.  Thanks Brene, for continuing to challenge the status quo!",454,ebook
Any of Bren<U+00E9> Brown<U+2019>s books are beyond worth the read!  This particular book though is one that everyone in the world should read.  Thank you Mrs. Brown!,455,ebook
"I have read many of Ms. Brown's books and ""Braving the Wilderness"" is NOW my new favorite.  Brene speaks to all of us who have at one time or another felt lonely or that we don't belong.  As always, she uses her humor and story telling ability to produce a book that is not only insightful but fun and interesting. This book gives insight on what the you and the entire world needs NOW to bring about a deeper understanding of each other--especially those that think and act differently than you.  In addition, I couldn't believe how much being lonely affects a person's health!?!?  I'm in the health and nutrition world. I'm always looking for insight as to how to keep my clients healthy and happy.  This book gave me a completely different perspective of the importance of community and personal connection--and why they are SO important for our health.  This helps explain why the seven longest living areas of the world (Blue Zones) live the longest--they all have STRONG communities.  This book is invaluable. EVERYBODY needs to read this book. This book is going to be a Xmas gift to all my clients.",456,ebook
"It's impossible to put down. Even though I was in a hurry and really didn't have time for reading, it got finished very quickly. Cried at some points, had other strong emotions on others, really loved all the stories the book has. Certainly reccomend it.",457,ebook
Started out good but became politicized and preachy. I find value in not letting our differences come between our relationships but I felt the book pushed too much in one direction politically.,458,ebook
This is another amazing book from Brene Brown. I just love it!! Read it and your life and prespective will change forever.,459,ebook
"Brene writes as only she can...her vulnerability, authenticity, and heart felt writing is unparalleled. Don't miss this one. Her insight and challenge is worth the read.",460,ebook
"More greatness from Dr. Brene' Brown. Insight and wisdom on standing on your own while connecting with others and having hard conversations.  The truths in this book can help us rise above the caustic divisiveness that is so prevalent today, and can help us find our way back to each other and our common humanity.",461,ebook
"This, I believe, is Brene's best and most vulnerable book yet. As I listened to her tell her stories, her experiences, her personal examples of not belonging and of exclusion, I cried with understanding. And as she relayed personal moments of witnessing collective loving and belonging, I cried with understanding. This book illustrates how incredibly important it is for us to be personal and vulnerable with each other because as Brene tells us, it's hard to hate up close; lean in.",462,ebook
Phenomal read. Bren<U+00E9><U+2019>s best yet.,463,ebook
Brenae has a certain vulnerability which draws me to her writing and I feel enraptured and engaged in the words she has penned!

"Here's what I loved about this book: Brene Brown's writing style and overall message that it's harder to  hate people up close and when we choose to only associate with people who agree with us we are venturing into dangerous territory for everyone.  Also, she maps out how to ""brave the wilderness"" and her map is truly helpful.  I love the title of this book and she is hilarious when she describes how hard it was to choose.  Nailed it!Here's what bugged me.  Her lengthy description of feeling left out as a child.  Luckily, this is the beginning part so it's over just like her childhood. I'm also suspect when she promotes a book called Option B by Sheryl Sandberg.  My hunch is she loves the author, not the book. I read the book and it succeeded neither as a self-help book or memoir but, I think it would have been a really good memoir if Sheryl Sandberg had chosen that path.Also, Brene Brown talks at length about her admiration for the late great Dr. Maya Angelou.  I am also an admirer and remain one after having read Sharon Murphy's wonderful book, ""Disappearing Act.""  Murphy's book is well-written, gripping and rings true.  She will never get press though, or a big publishing machine behind her and if you read the book, you'll know why.Lastly, after reading ""Braving the Wilderness,"" I looked up the word ""gypped"" for usage and history.  Here is what I found as a usage note:  ExpandGyp in the meanings <U+201C>to swindle<U+201D> or <U+201C>a person who swindles<U+201D> is sometimes perceived as insulting to or by Gypsies, since it stereotypes them as swindlers. However, gyp has apparently never been used as a deliberate ethnic slur, and many people are unaware that it is derived from Gypsy.So there you have it, if anyone freaks out on you for saying,  ""I got gypped by that a guy twice yesterday.""  Don't worry.  You haven't said a ""bad"" word.  You've said a common word that is widely understood.  Isn't all language offensive at some point if we keep tracing to find the offended ones?If you are born into humanity, you will feel left-out or bullied from time to time.  It happens to everyone.  What if we start teaching our children to ""take no offense?""  Wouldn't that be nice?  And, it's possible!  Keep reading and growing.  This book is good for that.",468,ebook
I found this book as I was looking for something to help with negativity in our world.  I only made it to the 3rd Chapter and she wants to go on about politics and preach about the division in our country.  She brings up the last election and hatred like it just started with the last election.  I don't need to be preached to from her thank you very much! All this book did for me was piss me off even more.,469,ebook
Very insightful,470,ebook
Excellent read.,471,ebook
"The foundational question behind this book couldn<U+2019>t be more timely or compelling: Why can<U+2019>t we get along? Why have we sorted ourselves into fortified ideological camps, relying on weaponized words to keep the marauders from the other camp at bay? In doing so we have not found solace but have paralyzed public debate and social progress. And we<U+2019>re lonely.The author is right, of course.Dr. Brown believes fear is at the heart of the problem. And the solution she advocates is to follow your <U+201C>wild heart<U+201D> into the wilderness beyond your encampment. The rules of engagement in the wildnerness, should you encounter like-hearted souls from the other encampment, and you will, are civility, a developed and willing ability to listen, and recognition that what we all seek is real belonging. To find it we must call out BS, be generous, and above all else, hold your ground.Dr. Brown is a social research scientist. And science, of course, is all about cause and effect. Research science is a protocol for analyzing data, preferably in large amounts, discerning the patterns that emerge, and applying those patterns to larger, related questions. It is a product of deductive logic, often characterized today as reasoned intelligence.It<U+2019>s a process and a world view that dominates all of our institutions today. Politicians conduct polls, businesses mine Big Data, and the traditionally soft academic sciences like evolutionary psychology and social science conduct research. All well and good.There are, however, several limitations to this definition of reasoned intelligence. In the extreme it is assumed to be both infallible and all-inclusive. The conclusions, as a result, tend to be one-dimensional and strongly held. There is little room for Socratic debate.The potential myopia of the approach is evident in the fact that words come to take on rigid and deistic meaning. Dr. Brown notes, <U+201C>We are hardwired to believe what we see and to attach meaning to the words we hear.<U+201D> And, <U+201C>Dehumanizing always starts with language<U+2026><U+201D>Language, however, is a human convention. It<U+2019>s not natural to the universe like rain or oxygen. Words are mere symbols, and while symbols are indeed important, they acquire real meaning only in context. In some languages, like Mandarin, the very meaning of a word, in fact, is often defined by that context.If it sounds like I<U+2019>m starting to make the case that <U+201C>guns don<U+2019>t kill, people do,<U+201D> I<U+2019>m not. I<U+2019>m making the opposite case. Guns exist for only one purpose<U+2014>to shoot bullets<U+2014>and bullets do, as a matter of science, kill people.Words, however, do not exist in such a single dimension. The belief that they do is at the heart of political correctness, which is ultimately the belief in the rigidity of meaning and all-inclusive intent.In this case Dr. Brown notes, <U+201C>Successful dehumanizing, however, creates moral exclusion.<U+201D> It is, therefore, a short hop to the observation that, <U+201C>Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization.<U+201D>And this has given rise to the ultimate false dilemma: <U+201C>You are either with us or against us,<U+201D> that is at the heart of identity politics. It<U+2019>s an abominable and flawed dilemma that falsely digitizes all opinion. And I fully agree with Dr. Brown in condemning it.The alternative, however, is not another false dilemma. And here is where I always stumble in my attempts to get to the heart of the very important issue raised by this book. Are words like inclusion, humanity, rehumanization, and underdog digital in their meaning? They are clearly less digital that words like hate, prejudice, and arrogance. Ultimately, however, they are words and someone has to arbitrate their meaning.The books devotes ample space to what Brown calls <U+201C>BS<U+2019>ing.<U+201D> (She spells out the word but I wasn<U+2019>t sure the moderator would accept that.) <U+201C>I love the idea of speaking truth to bullsh*t<U+2026><U+201D> She continues, <U+201C>It<U+2019>s helpful to think of lying as a defiance of the truth and bullsh*tting as a wholesale dismissal of the truth,<U+201D> often found in discussions <U+201C>driven by emotion rather than shared understanding of the facts.<U+201D>In this case, Brown knocks uncertainty as a cop-out, in keeping with the scientist<U+2019>s rational perspective. The opposite of clarity is ignorance and she cites Professor Harry Frankfurt<U+2019>s work on the topic to prove the point, identifying the culprit as <U+201C>our being skeptical and denying that we can ever know the truth of how things truly are.<U+201D> As a denial of the digital perspective, however, that itself is a digital weapon.The prose on BS<U+2019>ing, as a result, reminded me of the term first coined by Steward Chaplin in 1900 and popularized by Teddy Roosevelt<U+2014><U+201C>weasel words.<U+201D> These are the words that suck the meaning out of claims much like the weasel sucks the meat out of the egg while leaving the shell intact. They provide cover for misleading claims and politicians and business executives use them every day.In the end, I fully agree and support the basic premise of this book. It is a worthy and noble aspiration. I only wish we could focus more on behavior and less on language. If a picture is worth a thousand words a behavior is worth ten thousand pictures. To borrow from the words of Supreme Court Justice Potter Steward, I know hate when I see it. I know prejudice when I see it. And, ultimately, I know fairness when I see it, although that is often perhaps the least digital word in our language; being, as it often is, in the eye of the beholder.This book is a very good read that I recommend for just about everyone. On balance I am undoubtedly in Dr. Brown<U+2019>s <U+201C>group<U+201D>, as it were. There is, however, an old saying that people will remember you not for what you say or do, but how you made them feel. No one ever lay on their deathbed and said, <U+201C>Bring me all my stuff.<U+201D> The need for human connection, as Dr. Brown so eloquently points out, is supreme to all other human needs. (Maslow put it before self-esteem and self-actualization.)I only hope that we don<U+2019>t continue to let our words alone define the discussion. That role belongs to the heart, not the tongue. It is the heart that will lead us into Dr. Brown<U+2019>s wilderness where real diversity thrives.",472,ebook
"I cannot say enough about the profound impact of this book. I once heard that if you never had a mother or a father who guided you in life, choose your own mother and father. I adopted Brene Brown as my mother and although I don't usually buy brand new books when Braving the Wilderness came out I grabbed a copy right away. Her description of belonging is heart aching, her exploration of civility life changing. I was able to take what I learned from this book and walk into a family gathering a week later with a calm heart and a clear mind as I listened to family members spouting off opinions that would usually send me directly into a fight or flight response.

"This book is a major failure for Brene Brown and disappointment for her loyal followers like myself. What made her unique compared to many other self-help authors was that she based her claims and concept of vulnerability on her research in the literature world where every cancer survivor from the USA comes up with a book. This book starts well with the introduction of the concept of ""wilderness"". Then the author loses her focus. We make a deep dive reading into her companies, her being the CEO, gun control, no control, her political views, her community, here and there sprinkles of maya angelou's quotes (way too many) and she concludes all with ""be kind to each other"". wow. This book does not add any value to your life unless you are the average mary and joe from the southern USA. Her earlier books were amazing but this one is written just to get her paycheck from the publisher I guess.",478,ebook

"Another thought provoking book from Brene Brown, so full of relevant and life-changing messages.",482,ebook
I was disappointed in this book. I love Brene Brown's work and have read all her books. This one was like reading a sociology book and incredibly short. I thought I had at least a few more chapters to go and then turned the page to 30 pages of acknowledgements and index. Definitely check this one out at the library rather than buying.,483,ebook
"Too simplistic. Maybe I am just old, but this type of belly button examination just seems dumb. I could not stomach more than a chapter or so. Might be okay for a teenager but I cannot imagine a grown women finding this of value.  Sorry I bought it - just shows that NY Times bestsellers are not always worth reading.",484,ebook
"It's OK.  I have read all of her books.  I was really looking forward to this one, but it was a disappointing.  Very little new material.  I hope she does not become one of those authors who start writing the same stuff over and over again.  A friend asked me about it and I said, ""Get it at the library, but don't buy it.""This one is very political. I happen to agree with her political ideology, so it didn't bother me.  But I wasn't expecting a political book.  This is also going to date the book.  Her other books will stand the test of time.  This one probably won't.If you have never read any of Brown's work, you will probably like this.  But if you have read her other work, you will find this to be disappointing because it isn't as good as Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, Gifts of Imperfection, or I Thought It Was Just Me.",485,ebook
"This is an amazing book. If you have ever felt a desire to belong or felt like an outsider looking in, this will speak to all your wounds and give great guidance to finding that belonging really belongs to you all along. Thank you Brene Brown for your courage to be real, vulnerable and speak to the sadness, loneliness and connection we all crave.",486,ebook
"I genuinely enjoyed her other books and was greatly looking forward to her newest. I was a little skeptical because since her books are all based on her research I had my reservations how she could do enough new research and write a book in the short time since her last book. But I trusted her as her other books were very well done in my opinion.I ended up being correct. It's a short book with a big font size and wide spacing. It didn't really say much. Very shallow and fluffy. Not at all intilectual. Most of it is her saying stories about herself with a few half decent thoughts. (You would think someone with over 200,000 pages of research would have some stories to tell about other people.)It also was very preachy, basically sounded like her screaming at the world for half of the book. I agree that there are a lot of problems in the world but this is very different than her other books. I really had the feeling that she just had to get something off her chest.On top of all this she gets very political. I happen to agree with the one nice thought that the book contained - that we shouldn't be so all or nothing when viewing people with different political views. But I didn't buy the book to hear her rant about politics. Nowhere in the title or book description does it mention that she would be discussing politics.In general her writing style is very different/unique  as she is extremely flowery and metaphorical which often leaves me confused as to what she is trying to say. With her other books there was enough content for me to struggle through that, but with this one I really couldn't do so as much as before as there really isn't much there.Also in general she quotes her research a lot. But she never spells out her research, how it was done, etc. She just says ""the research says"" and your left to take her word for it. Qualitative research leaves a lot of room for the interpretation of the researcher. As such it is really important to know what information she is interpreting and not just rely on her. Unfortunately she never provides us with this information. Again this bothered me with her previous books, but at least there was enough content to make the book still worth it. Here it was just a lot of fluff, stories about herself, ranting, and politics.All in all, I really got the feeling that she wrote the book just because she knows that her name recognition alone will make her a ton of money off of sales. Next time I won't preorder the book rather I'll wait to read other reviews.",487,ebook

"There are times when, in order to be accepted by the society around us, we are required to act in ways that we know can have seriously destructive consequences for others.

Brene Brown <U+201C>hits it out of the park<U+201D> once again!  She goes into more depth and detail about this lack of <U+201C>love and belonging<U+201D> many of us seem to be feeling of late and applies it to the current political climate as well. I loved how Brene applied her research/theories to her own life and tells story of her own <U+201C>imperfections.<U+201D>  She is a wonderful story teller!  This is a fantastic book - as good or better than those she<U+2019>s written so far. Keep them coming!,500,ebook
